<small>A NIGHT TO BE YOUNG</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Nothing</span> ever happens in this town,&#8221; said Eben Poore,
dangling his long legs over the edge of the wharf, and
looking down river to the open sea. The sky was pale, almost
white above the long sand bar of Plum Island, he noticed,
but the streets were growing dark behind him, and twilight
had begun to gather round the warehouses and tall-masted
ships by the waterside.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; agreed Dick Moody, &#8220;nothing ever happens in
Newburyport. Wish we could have a &#8216;tea party&#8217; like they had
in Boston a spell back. I&#8217;d sure enough be glad to rig up like
an Indian and heave a chest of bohea overside.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess all the merchants know better than to bring it
in,&#8221; said Johnny Pettengall. &#8220;Nobody&#8217;d drink the stuff. We
got no name o&#8217; being a Tory town.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny was older than the other boys, seventeen past. He
had his own gun and drilled with the militia on muster days.</p>

<p>&#8220;But something has happened in Newburyport,&#8221; he went
on, &#8220;though I don&#8217;t suppose it would mean very much to
either o&#8217; you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did happen?&#8221; asked Dick lazily. &#8220;Somebody&#8217;s cat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
kitten, or Indian Joe take too much rum and do a war dance in
Queen Street again?&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny shook his head and smiled. &#8220;Sally Rose Townsend&#8217;s
back,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The other boys sat up, and their faces brightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care much for girls,&#8221; said Eben, picking a piece
of long brown seaweed from the dock&#8217;s end and shredding it
in his fingers. &#8220;But Sally Rose is different. Maybe it&#8217;s her
hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Having gold-colored hair never hurt a girl none,&#8221; declared
Johnny, with the air of a man who knew about such
things, a man grown. &#8220;But with Sally Rose&mdash;well, it&#8217;s the
way she smiles, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like Kitty better,&#8221; said Dick stoutly. &#8220;Sally Rose is
always grinning&mdash;at everybody. When Kitty smiles, there&#8217;s
some sense to it&mdash;when she&#8217;s pleased, or you tell her a joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s Sally Rose doing in Newburyport this time o&#8217;
year?&#8221; asked Eben. &#8220;She comes in the summer to visit
Granny Greenleaf and her cousin Kitty, but it&#8217;s still early
spring&mdash;April nineteenth, for I took me a look at the almanac
this morning. See, there&#8217;s the first log raft from New Hampshire
just tied up today.&#8221;</p>

<p>The other boys looked where he pointed. Through the
gathering darkness they saw that a drift of shaggy logs covered
the whole surface of a little cove nearby. Lanterns
flashed here and there, and a dim shouting echoed among the
narrow lanes and small brick houses beside the river. The
lumbermen who had brought the raft down from the great
forests farther up the Merrimack, were moving about it now,
making everything fast for the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a warm spring,&#8221; said Johnny, smiling quietly to
himself.</p>

<p>Dick shivered and turned up the collar of his homespun
jacket. &#8220;Maybe it has,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it&#8217;s cold enough tonight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
to freeze your gizzard. Hope there won&#8217;t be a frost, with
the apple trees already budded and most o&#8217; the fields plowed.
But what&#8217;s that got to do with Sally Rose? Her father keeps
a tavern in Charlestown, shops and houses all round, and the
seasons don&#8217;t matter. Spring don&#8217;t mean nothing there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a lot stirring round Charlestown this spring,
Sally Rose says,&#8221; continued Johnny. &#8220;Looks like the British
soldiers in Boston might be &#8217;most ready to come out and fight.
We been expecting it, and we got plenty o&#8217; powder laid by, at
Concord and a few places more. Might need to use it any
time now. Sally Rose&#8217;s father thought she&#8217;d be safer here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did she tell you that?&#8221; asked Eben quickly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
talked with her then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I talked with her,&#8221; said Johnny. He turned his dark
head a little and looked up the hill at the lighted town behind
them, starlight over the dormer windows set high in the
rooftops, the church steeple white against the night sky. He
seemed to be watching for something. He did not say any
more.</p>

<p>A group of sailors swaggered by, jesting and laughing, on
their way to the Wolfe Tavern after grog. The spring wind
brought a salt smell up from the river, a fish smell, and the
clean scent of pine logs from the raft in the cove. One lone
candle burned in the window of a counting house nearby and
showed them a figure hunched over a tall desk and open
ledger. Dick pointed suddenly toward it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shiver my jib and start my planks if I&#8217;d want to be a
counting-house clerk!&#8221; he exclaimed. Dick was apprenticed to
his uncle in the ship-building trade, but what he wanted was
to go to sea. Eben, an orphan, did chores at a boardinghouse
in Chandler&#8217;s Lane, and Johnny helped his father on their
farm below the town, a farm known for its poor soil and
salt hay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>Before anyone could answer him, a girl&#8217;s laugh rang out,
somewhere in the shadowy streets above.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Sally Rose!&#8221; cried Eben. &#8220;I&#8217;d know her laugh in
Jamaicy&mdash;if I was to hear it there! She&mdash;she&mdash;you knew she
was coming down here, Johnny! You knew!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I knew,&#8221; said Johnny. There was a light in his eye,
a reflection from the counting-house candle, perhaps. &#8220;She
said she and Kit might take a walk this way, if Granny Greenleaf
would let them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Granny did,&#8221; cried Dick, &#8220;for she&#8217;s coming, and
Kitty with her. Look there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Two girls came tripping gaily toward them, their full
skirts sweeping the rutted lane, little white shawls drawn
about their shoulders, their hair brushed back from their faces
and falling in curls behind. One girl&#8217;s hair was soft brown,
and the other&#8217;s yellow like Indian corn.</p>

<p>The boys stood up. Johnny went forward. &#8220;I been waiting
for you, Sally Rose,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Sally Rose walked slowly toward him, her head lifted, her
eyes shining. She put out both her hands. &#8220;My, you&#8217;re handsome,
Johnny,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d forgotten how handsome you
were. We don&#8217;t have lads like you in Charlestown, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny gripped both her hands against the front of his
jacket and took a deep breath. The other boys looked embarrassed.
Eben stared down at his feet. He suddenly realized
that they were bare, bare and not very clean. He owned a pair
of shoes, of course, but he only wore them on Sundays and
in the wintertime.</p>

<p>&#8220;Glad you came back, Sally Rose,&#8221; he said, not looking at
her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, Eben,&#8221; she answered sweetly. &#8220;I&#8217;m so
glad that you&#8217;re glad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny opened his eyes wide and gave Eben an unfriendly
stare.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>&#8220;Hey, Kit,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen you since&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The brown-haired girl smiled. &#8220;You&#8217;d have seen me if
you&#8217;d looked,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I passed you by the ropewalk last
Friday afternoon. I was going to Polly Little&#8217;s to bring home
some tulip bulbs for Granny. I waved to you, but you
wouldn&#8217;t see me. You were too busy cleaning a tar barrel.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick looked down at the worn planks of Somerby&#8217;s Wharf.
It was dark beside the river now, and the only light came
from the windowpanes of the small houses along the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Kitty,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter, Dick,&#8221; she answered. Her blue eyes
smiled at him. Her voice sounded soothing and kind.</p>

<p>The five of them stood there, silent in the spring night
and the sharp sea wind. Johnny shifted his feet uneasily.
Even Sally Rose did not know what to do or say.</p>

<p>Finally Eben spoke. His voice quavered a little, harsh,
and self-conscious, and high. &#8220;If I had a shilling,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;I&#8217;d ask you all to come up to the Wolfe Tavern and have
a glass of beer.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dick snorted. &#8220;Lot of good a shilling would do you there!&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Ma&#8217;am Davenport&#8217;s real strict. She won&#8217;t sell drink
to lads of thirteen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben wilted for a moment. Then Sally Rose smiled at him,
and he squared his shoulders and stood up taller than before.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for the taste of beer,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perhaps I
see too much of it in Father&#8217;s tavern as it passes over the
board. But thank you, Eben. It was a kind thought.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned to Johnny, and her voice grew low and soft.
&#8220;Will there be a moon?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>He answered her gruffly. &#8220;Not till later. Much later, after
the bells have rung curfew; after you girls are home abed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;?&#8221; answered Sally Rose provocatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, here we are, Sally Rose,&#8221; said Kitty in a brisk tone,
&#8220;You said you wanted to come down to the river.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>She looked out at the dark flowing stream with the river
barges and fishing smacks and deep-sea-going ships moored
on its quiet surface, lanterns in their rigging, their tall masts
reared against the sky, and their sails furled tight. Ships home
from Virginia and the Barbados, from all over the world,
maybe; their holds full of sugar and rice and wine, silks and
laces and oil, India muslins, and French knickknacks, and
gunpowder out of Holland&mdash;even if they carried no tea. Try
as they would, the King&#8217;s laws hadn&#8217;t been able to interfere
too much with trade.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now that you&#8217;re here,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;what do you want
to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could go for a walk through the marshes, Plum Island
way,&#8221; said Sally Rose, looking at Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of us?&#8221; he asked her. Kitty and Eben and Dick ought
to know that he meant for them to go away and leave him
alone with Sally Rose. But they didn&#8217;t go.</p>

<p>&#8220;We could all go back to our house and have plum cake
and buttermilk,&#8221; suggested Kitty. &#8220;Granny cut a new plum
cake yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben&#8217;s voice rose high and shrill again. &#8220;We could play
hide-and-seek,&#8221; he announced boldly.</p>

<p>Sally Rose giggled. Then she clapped a hand over her
mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only for young &#8217;uns,&#8221; muttered Dick. &#8220;I be too
big for that now.&#8221;</p>

<p>But suddenly Kitty defended the idea.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, of course, Dick,&#8221; she said wistfully. &#8220;But
then, don&#8217;t you sometimes hate to feel you&#8217;re getting too big
for the things that used to be fun? Eben&#8217;s the youngest of us,
and he finished school more than a year ago. Soon we&#8217;ll be
grown and married, with houses and children, and we won&#8217;t
be able to run out after dark like this, and walk by the river,
and watch for the moon. We&#8217;ll have to stay in, and rock babies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and split firewood, and see that the doors are locked and the
table set for breakfast. It&#8217;ll come on us all so soon now.&#8221; She
looked at Johnny appealingly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s have one last play
night&mdash;one night to be young&mdash;before we grow too old.&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny&#8217;s eyes widened suddenly, and his mouth curved in
a smile. Sally Rose had a cluster of apple buds pinned on her
bodice, and their sweetness hovered all about. It made him
feel sad, and happy, and unsettled as a girl, ready to agree to
anything, even Kitty&#8217;s daft notion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right enough, Kit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;For one more night, we&#8217;ll
be young. We&#8217;ll play hide-and-seek, if we never do again.
I&#8217;ll count first, and the rest of you hide. This&#8217;ll be goal, this
empty rum keg here.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down on the rum keg and buried his face in his
hands. &#8220;Ten&mdash;fifteen&mdash;twenty&mdash;&#8221; he began slowly.</p>

<p>With a little squeal, Sally Rose picked up her skirts and ran
to hide behind a pile of lobster crates in a far corner. The
others hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forty-five&mdash;fifty&mdash;&#8221; went on Johnny, still very slow.</p>

<p>They scattered then. Eben crawled under a ship&#8217;s boat,
broken and lying sideways on the wharf. Dick ran into a
doorway across the lane. Kitty waited until she had barely
time to crouch down behind a pile of wooden boxes marked
with a black &#8220;W. I.&#8221;&mdash;West India goods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ninety-five&mdash;one hundred&mdash;here I come!&#8221; Johnny
shouted. He stood up and peered around him, but only for a
moment. In almost no time at all he found Sally Rose, but it
was a little longer before he pulled her out from behind the
lobster crates. Perhaps he had peeked through his fingers,
Kitty thought, so that he knew where to look. Perhaps he
kissed Sally Rose before they were in plain sight again.</p>

<p>Anyway, it was now Sally Rose&#8217;s turn to count, and she
found Dick with little trouble.</p>

<p>But after that they really did seem to be young again, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
entered into the spirit of the game. Gradually the counting
got slower, and the hiding places farther and farther away.
Then Sally Rose and Kitty hid together behind a heap of
mackerel nets, and Eben found them both at the same time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tie find! Now which of you&#8217;s to count and go seek?&#8221;
asked Dick, putting up his head in the sharp wind. &#8220;Just about
once more, and &#8217;twill be curfew time, and we&#8217;ll have to go
home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll count,&#8221; offered Kitty.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, let me,&#8221; said Sally Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about me having a turn?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a strange voice that spoke, a boy&#8217;s voice, quiet and
cool, but with a mocking note of laughter in it.</p>

<p>They turned around suddenly and stared. There on the
wharf behind them stood a tall fellow not much older than
Johnny, with a lean face, sharp gray eyes, and sun-bleached
hair. He wore cowhide boots and a loose hunting shirt over
moosehide breeches. He carried a long pole with an iron barb
on the end, such as the lumbermen used to break up log jams
and herd the great rafts down the river.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m know I&#8217;m a stranger here,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;but I ain&#8217;t
poison. I been watching you awhile. I&#8217;d like a hand in the
game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You came down river with the logs?&#8221; asked Dick slowly.</p>

<p>The stranger nodded. &#8220;Aye, clear from the falls at Derryfield.
A fellow can be lonely&mdash;away from his own town at
night&mdash;first time away.&#8221; The sharpness went out of his eyes,
and he looked younger, almost like a little boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course you can play,&#8221; cried Kitty, sympathy in her
voice. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been lonely, too, sometimes, when I went to visit
Sally Rose in Charlestown, and I know what it&#8217;s like. He can
count this time, can&#8217;t he, Sally Rose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course he can,&#8221; said Sally Rose, smiling at the strange
lad, flicking her lashes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Dick and Eben looked crestfallen. Johnny kicked the side
of the rum keg. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t know backwoodsmen could count,&#8221;
he sneered. &#8220;Tell us what your name is, if you want to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>The stranger narrowed his eyes, then he opened them wide
and smiled innocently. &#8220;My name&#8217;s Tom Trask,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and I can count.&#8221; He put his head down in the crook of his
arm, but they did not hear the familiar &#8220;Ten&mdash;fifteen&mdash;twenty&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>After a moment, thinking he might be counting to himself,
they started to straggle away. Kitty did not watch where the
others went to. Seconds mattered at a time like this. She
slipped behind a row of tar barrels at the corner of the counting
house and stood there, listening to the water as it sucked
at the piles underneath, to the sound of singing and fiddle
music where the sailors were making merry on the deck of a
ship moored a hundred yards off shore.</p>

<p>Suddenly the voice of the young logger from up the
Merrimack whipped out like the command of the captain to
the volunteers who drilled on Frog Pond green come muster
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ten&mdash;ten&mdash;double ten&mdash;forty-five&mdash;fifteen!&#8221;</p>

<p>He reached his hundred all at once, leaped from the keg,
and ran straight toward her, toward her, Kitty Greenleaf, of
the High Street in Newburyport, who had never seen him
before tonight. He ran to her, around the tar barrels, around
the corner of the counting house. In a moment he had put his
arms about her and kissed her on the mouth, kissed her hard.</p>

<p>Not used to such sudden attack, not used to kissing any lad
at all, except in kissing games where everybody looked on
and laughed, or when Dick bade her a shy good night sometimes
by the garden wall, she struggled, and sputtered, and
pulled away.</p>

<p>She wiped her mouth and looked up. &#8220;What&mdash;what did
you do that for?&#8221; she gasped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>The gray eyes were smiling down at her, there in the chilly
spring dark, the thin mouth crooked upward in a smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like I said, a lad&#8217;s lonely in a strange town at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Before she could answer, she heard a soft little laugh
beside them. She turned about. There stood Sally Rose. Sally
Rose flickered her long lashes and opened her hazel eyes
very wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no need for you to be lonely,&#8221; she trilled. &#8220;My,
but you&#8217;re a handsome lad! We&#8217;ve none such handsome lads
in Charlestown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Trask eyed her coldly. His mouth was still smiling,
but his eyes looked sharp and unfriendly in the candlelight
that shone through the dusty panes of the counting-house
window behind his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Charlestown can&#8217;t be much of a place,&#8221; he retorted,
&#8220;though I wouldn&#8217;t know, for my business never took me
there, and &#8217;tisn&#8217;t likely to. But&mdash;&#8221; He paused a moment, and
his head lifted a little. &#8220;Up the Merrimack we got prettier
girls than you. Maybe a score.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose&#8217;s eyes flashed, and she tossed her curls. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
care what&#8217;s up the Merrimack. I look pretty enough in
Charlestown! Pretty enough to please Captain Gerald
Malory of the Twenty-third!&#8221;</p>

<p>The logger did not answer her. He turned around and
walked slowly down the wharf. Kitty could hear the ring of
the iron nails in the soles of his country boots as he strode
away.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Two</i><br />


<small>IN READINESS TO MARCH</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Insolent</span> plowboy!&#8221; exclaimed Sally Rose haughtily. She
stood in front of the mirror wreathed with gilt cupids,
her palms flat on the mahogany dressing table, and stared
at her own reflection, curls loosened and falling over the
shoulders of her white cambric night robe, her eyes narrowed
and glinting coldly in the candlelight. Then the coldness
dissolved away, and she giggled.</p>

<p>Kitty, lying sprawled on the patchwork counterpane that
covered the great four-poster bed, giggled too, uncertainly.
Sally Rose had moods that changed so fast she was never able
to keep up with them. So, as usual, she didn&#8217;t try, but spoke
her mind in her turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;He wasn&#8217;t a plowboy, he was a logger,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Maybe
the owner of a whole forest as big as this parish. Some of
them are, you know, those up-country lads. And he was too
smart for you, Sally Rose. He knew you were making fun
of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose sat down on the counterpane and hugged her
knees. She looked thoughtful. &#8220;Yes, he knew,&#8221; she said. &#8220;But
when I said the same thing to Johnny Pettengall, Johnny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
thought I meant it. Inside, I almost laughed myself to death.
I wonder why I couldn&#8217;t fool that backwoods boy, when I
could fool Johnny.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe because he&#8217;s older,&#8221; suggested Kitty. &#8220;He looked
older, anyway.&#8221; She got up, went to the chest, and blew the
candle out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; reflected Sally Rose, &#8220;older, but not really a man&mdash;not
so much as twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that how old he is?&#8221; Kitty demanded. &#8220;Come on now,
Sally Rose. Tell me all about him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About who?&#8221; asked Sally Rose. &#8220;The logger? Tom
Trask was his name, he said. I don&#8217;t know anything about
Tom Trask, except that I caught him kissing you. I wonder
why you didn&#8217;t stop him. If Granny finds out&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have time to stop him,&#8221; retorted Kitty severely.
&#8220;And don&#8217;t try to change the subject. The &#8216;him&#8217; I want to
know about is that British officer. Captain Malory of the
Twenty-third.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; exclaimed Sally Rose uneasily. She, too, left the
bed, and went to stand between the patchwork curtains at the
window. It was nearly midnight. Late moonrise silvered the
sky over Plum Island, and the young leaves stirred restlessly
in the sea wind, hiding the quiet darkness of Granny&#8217;s crocus
and daffodil beds in the garden below.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know you really want to tell me about him,&#8221; continued
Kitty. &#8220;You always want to tell me about the lads
you&#8217;ve taken a fancy to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose did not turn, and when she answered, her voice
was very quiet, with none of the usual merry undertones that
made it so charming. &#8220;Oh, but this is different, Kitty. You
guessed right&mdash;he is twenty. And Father says he&#8217;s an enemy.&#8221;
She laughed ruefully. &#8220;In fact, Father says he&#8217;s a damned
lobsterback, and I mustn&#8217;t see him again. But I sent him a
note to tell him where I was going, and maybe.... But how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
did you know he was British? You only heard me say his
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty could feel her face burn in the darkness. She still
felt ashamed, though it hadn&#8217;t been her fault, really.</p>

<p>&#8220;I read it in a letter,&#8221; she said with some stiffness, &#8220;the
letter your father wrote to Granny, telling her why he was
sending you here. I went down to meet the postrider, and
when he handed me a letter addressed to C. Greenleaf, I
never thought that it was for Granny instead of me, and so I
read it. Of course she&#8217;s Catherine, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Father say?&#8221; asked Sally Rose. Her voice had
a worried sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;It began, &#8216;My dear,&#8217; instead of &#8216;Dear Mother&#8217;&mdash;that&#8217;s
why I didn&#8217;t know it was for Gran, and I kept on reading. He
said &#8216;I&#8217;m worried about our little girl.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty paused, and Sally Rose did not question her any
further just then. Both girls looked through the window,
over the roofs of the town, at the wide dark waters of the
Merrimack flowing seaward.</p>

<p>Fifteen years ago, about this time of the year, Caleb Greenleaf
had taken his wife, Becky, and his married sister, Anne
Townsend, for a little jaunt on the river in the April sunshine.
The young mothers had left their baby girls with
Granny Greenleaf, and gone happily aboard his small fishing
boat, and no one had foreseen the sudden mad wind, the
squall of snow that would engulf them. Afterwards, Granny
had brought up orphan Kitty, but Job Townsend had taken
his motherless daughter back to Charlestown to his own
people. The tragedy had brought him close to his mother-in-law,
however, so that he still addressed her as &#8216;My dear,&#8217;
and spoke of &#8216;our little girl,&#8217; and there had been much going
back and forth between them.</p>

<p>For a long moment now, the girls stared at the dark river.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Kitty was the first to take her eyes away. She did not refer to
the old, sad loss, of which she knew they were both thinking.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your father wrote that he was sending you to stay with
us for a while,&#8221; she said quietly, &#8220;to get you away from that
British officer you&#8217;ve been stealing out with. He said this&mdash;this
enemy&mdash;puts on a homespun shirt and leather breeches,
pretends to be one of our lads, and goes wherever he likes,
on all the roads round Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose gave a soft little laugh. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Gerry
does that sometimes. But I like him better when he wears his
scarlet coat and his sword. He&#8217;s sure handsome enough to
make any girl forget about Johnny Pettengall.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a prideful note in Sally Rose&#8217;s voice as she
shook back her yellow hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s British, Sally Rose! He&#8217;s one of the King&#8217;s men
who&#8217;ve captured Boston, and closed the port, and made so
much trouble for the people who live there. Dick says they&#8217;ll
march out and start shooting at us any day now. You&#8217;d be
better off with a New England lad&mdash;even that logger.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose sighed. &#8220;I know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Wars are hard on
a girl, Kit. I know I&#8217;m supposed to hate the British, but how
can I, when they are so handsome&mdash;when they have such
gallant manners! I&#8217;ll bet wars don&#8217;t mean a thing to those
cupids round the mirror. Love doesn&#8217;t know Whig from
Tory. But why does he have to be&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Three sharp taps sounded on the other side of the bedroom
wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Granny&#8217;s cane!&#8221; cried Kit softly, lowering her voice to a
whisper. &#8220;That means we&#8217;re keeping her awake. But there&#8217;s
so much I want to hear. How you met this Gerry, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; breathed Sally Rose, remembering Granny&#8217;s
outbursts of short-lived peppery wrath. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>They slipped into bed and lay quiet, side by side, arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
relaxed on the counterpane, watching the moonlight along
the wall. First Kitty turned over and sighed. A few minutes
later Sally Rose did the same. Finally Kitty sat up and
punched her pillow. &#8220;I can&#8217;t sleep,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither can I,&#8221; said Sally Rose. &#8220;I feel as if something
were going to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>Below them in the town the church bells began to ring.</p>

<p>They rang and rang, and kept on ringing. Kitty could see
them in her mind, tossing wildly in their belfry, high over
Market Square. She sat up higher in bed. Sally Rose sat up,
too, and reached out for her cousin&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be a house afire,&#8221; said Kitty. &#8220;Can&#8217;t be a ship in
trouble. The wind isn&#8217;t that strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>She jumped out of bed and ran to the window, but no hot
glare lit the sky, only the cold pale light of the April moon.
Now a noise of shouting broke out in Fish Street, growing
louder every minute. Lights flickered behind the windowpanes
of the small wooden houses all about, and went on
burning, steady and strong. Shadows moved across them.
People were getting up.</p>

<p>Kitty turned from the window. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get dressed!&#8221; she
cried. &#8220;Maybe Granny will let us go and see what it&#8217;s all
about.&#8221; But Sally Rose was already fastening her petticoat.</p>

<p>Pulling large winter shawls about them to hide half-buttoned
bodices and yawning plackets, they tiptoed into the
hall, but Granny had got there ahead of them. She stood at
the top of the stairs, small, and neat, and wizened, looking as
if she were ready to go to church on a Sunday morning, her
costume complete, even to gold eardrops and a chip bonnet
with ostrich plumes. She had a lighted candle in one hand,
and her cane, which she carried but seldom used, in the other.
She opened her mouth to speak to them, but was interrupted
by a heavy knocking on the front door and a man&#8217;s voice
shouting for Timothy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Timothy Coffin, Granny&#8217;s hired man who tended the garden
and split the firewood, came tumbling down from his
tiny attic chamber. Gnarled and weathered, not much
younger than his employer, his arms were half in, half out
of his woolen jacket, and he carried an old flintlock, like himself,
a veteran of the siege of Louisburg thirty years ago.</p>

<p>&#8220;Git out o&#8217; my way, women,&#8221; he shouted, as he tore past
them. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it&#8217;s them varmints. I knowed they was about
to strike!&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny peered after him in bewilderment, as he fumbled
with the lock of the heavy front door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he mean the Indians?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;When I was a
girl I used to hear stories&mdash;but it seems they&#8217;re too scarce
hereabout to cause any trouble now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Timothy finally got the door open and stood there, listening
to a hoarse excited voice that spoke in the dark outside.
Suddenly he turned around.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m off, Ma&#8217;am Greenleaf!&#8221; he called to Granny. &#8220;Them
British dogs has struck at last. I signed the pledge for a
Minuteman. I swore to hold myself in readiness to march
whenever I be ordered. An&#8217; I be ordered now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going far, you&#8217;d better take some food with
you,&#8221; said Granny smartly. &#8220;Take all the bread in the cupboard,
and the cold chicken&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the plum cake,&#8221; interrupted Kitty. &#8220;We cut a plum
cake yesterday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going, Timothy? Where did the &#8216;British
dogs&#8217; strike?&#8221; asked Sally Rose, her eyes looking large in her
white face.</p>

<p>Timothy did not answer her. Instead he ducked into the
kitchen. The front door yawned open, and through it they
could hear the terrible clamor of the bells, the lift of excited
voices as the townspeople hastened by.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>&#8220;Come, girls,&#8221; said Granny. &#8220;I aim to learn what this commotion
is all about.&#8221;</p>

<p>They followed her out of the house and along High
Street, past the Frog Pond and the new training green laid
out where the windmill used to be.</p>

<p>A crowd had gathered in front of the Wolfe Tavern, and
they paused at the outskirts of it. Torches flared all about,
lighting up the portrait of General Wolfe that hung on a pole
near the tavern door, flickering on the windowpanes along
Fish Street and on the startled faces of the Newburyport folk.
Fashionable flounced ladies stood side by side with barefooted
fishwives from Flatiron Point, while toddlers clung
to their skirts, and urchins raced here and there, shouting with
shrill voices, as if they played some sort of exciting game.
Most of the men were gathered round the tavern&#8217;s high front
steps, and new arrivals kept elbowing their way forward
every minute. The throng bristled everywhere with gun barrels;
a flintlock, a fowling piece, an old queen&#8217;s arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Johnny,&#8221; said Sally Rose suddenly, and sure
enough, Kitty craned her neck and saw him standing with
the other men, his hands gripping a heavy musket. He was
watching the tavern door intently. He did not look their
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on here?&#8221; demanded Granny in a querulous
tone. Everybody seemed to be talking at once, but nobody
answered her.</p>

<p>A man wearing a blue coat and carrying a sword came out
of the tavern and stood still at the top of the steps, looking
round him. He held up his hand. The urchins stopped shouting.
The bells down the street pealed a time or two and then
were silent. The voices of the crowd died away. A sudden
burst of spring wind lifted a heap of dead leaves from the
gutter and swirled it high in the face of the round white
moon.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>The man on the steps began to speak. &#8220;Men o&#8217; the Port,&#8221;
he called out, in a voice that was low and deep, a voice that
without lifting or straining itself could be heard in all the
streets and lanes nearby, &#8220;New England blood&#8217;s been spilt,
as some o&#8217; you know. But for them that don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll read the
word the postrider brought.&#8221; He waved a paper aloft, then
held it square in front of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;To all friends of American Liberty, let it be known!
This morning before break of day, a brigade consisting of
some twelve hundred redcoats ... marched to Lexington ...
and on to Concord Bridge. Many were slain both sides, and
the roads are bloody. Another brigade is now upon the march
from Boston!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>He put the paper down. &#8220;Men o&#8217; the Port, such as signed
the pledge, &#8216;We do enlist ourselves as Minutemen and do
engage that we will hold ourselves in readiness to march!&#8217;
All such men to the training green! Fall in by companies!
Come, lads! Up the hill!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a cheer the men surged up Fish Street, shoulders
hunched and heads thrust forward, their guns gripped in
their hands. With cries of dismay and alarm the women
began to trail after them. Granny stood still, leaning on her
cane.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Dick and Eben,&#8221; cried Kitty. &#8220;Dick!&#8221; She lifted
her voice. &#8220;Dick, come here and tell me where they are
going. Dick, are you going too?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Dick and Eben were hurrying after the Minutemen.
They looked at the girls and waved, and then ran on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, here&#8217;s Mr. Cary,&#8221; Granny exclaimed. &#8220;Now we&#8217;ll
see what all this uproar is likely to lead to.&#8221; She trotted over
to the minister who was moving swiftly up the street, his wig
not quite straight, and the linen bands at his throat somewhat
disordered. &#8220;Mr. Cary, tell me now, what does all this
mean?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>The minister paused, adjusted his wig, and mopped his
brow with a lawn handkerchief. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid it means war,
Madame Greenleaf. It was bound to come. They&#8217;ve oppressed
us too far. But about this latest outrage&mdash;I myself
talked with the postrider, and he was there and saw it all. A
frightful slaughter!&#8221; He looked at the girls and lowered his
voice, but they heard him all the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;He says that when he left, the whole rout was fleeing
back towards Boston, but he heard Captain Parker say that if
they mean to have a war, let it begin here. &#8217;Twould seem
they so mean, and that it has begun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who were the redcoats?&#8221; asked Sally Rose in a small
tremulous voice. &#8220;Did he say if it was the Twenty-third?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cary looked at her sharply. &#8220;Who knows one redcoat
from another, and what does it matter?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;But
I believe he did mention the Twenty-third. It seems they
were not in the thickest of the engagement, but posted out to
help their fellow scoundrels home to Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose let her breath escape in a little sigh of relief.
Granny tapped her cane on a granite horse block nearby to
get Mr. Carey&#8217;s attention again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what do our lads think to do about it? Why get
folks out of bed in the middle of the night? Must we fortify
the Port and barricade ourselves in our houses because there&#8217;s
been a fuss in Lexington? Are the British headed for Frog
Pond Green?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Cary started to smile and then bit his lip. &#8220;Hardly
that, but our companies will assemble and march from there.
The word&#8217;s been passed for such men as are able to bear arms
to make their way to Cambridge with all speed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; said Granny. &#8220;Cambridge is a good ways off. I
hope Timothy took the plum cake. Come, girls! Now that
I&#8217;ve satisfied my mind, I&#8217;m going home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, Gran,&#8221; pleaded Sally Rose, composed and sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
of herself again, now that she felt reasonably certain her
British Gerry had come to no harm. &#8220;I want to go up to the
green and see them off. It&#8217;ll hearten them to have us there,
to have us wave them good luck as they march away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; snapped Granny. &#8220;The lads will have other
things on their minds. They got no time now for yellow hair.&#8221;</p>

<p>The squeal of a fife and the solemn throb of a beating
drum broke through the shouts of the crowd on the training
green.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to go back to bed,&#8221; pouted Sally Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why did you think you were going back to bed,
miss?&#8221; Granny demanded. &#8220;Parson Cary says there&#8217;s a war
begun. That means we&#8217;ll into the attic and try to find those
bullet molds I put away when I hoped we wouldn&#8217;t need
them any more. They haven&#8217;t been used since your grandfather&#8217;s
time, but I think likely they&#8217;re still there.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Three</i><br />


<small>TWO TO BEGIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;I &nbsp;told</span> you they&#8217;d fight,&#8221; said the young man grimly,
biting the end of a cartridge and letting a thin stream of
black powder dribble into the pan of his flintlock. He knelt at
the tail gate of the farm wagon that rattled and swayed from
side to side as Sergeant Higgs of the Twenty-third drove it
pell-mell down the Charlestown Road.</p>

<p>His hat was gone and his red coat in tatters. His white
breeches were stained with gunpowder and the blood of the
wounded men who lay on the floor of the wagon; stained,
too, with the gray earth of this unfamiliar country, so unlike
the ruddy loam of his native Devonshire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you they&#8217;d fight,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;I been amongst
&#8217;em, and I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nobody answered him, but he heard the roar of musket
fire back in the hills, the roar of flames from a burning house
in a grove of crooked trees a few yards away. He thought
impatiently that it had never taken him so long to load
before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut your pan. Charge with your cartridge. Draw your
hammer,&#8221; he muttered, as his fingers moved swiftly along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the reeking barrel. No old hand at this business of soldiering,
he felt reassured to find the phrases of the British Arms
Manual fall so readily from his tongue.</p>

<p>The cart rocked and rumbled down a narrow track at the
edge of the salt marshes. Moors, clay pits, and scrubby oak
trees stretched to the foot of the hillside on his left. To his
right, in the middle of the river, he could see the lights on
board the man-o&#8217;-war <i>Somerset</i>, and beyond them, the low
roofs and steeples of Boston. Would he ever present arms on
Boston Common again, or offer his own arms in another sort
of way to the pretty girls who went walking there? He began
to doubt it now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run down your cartridge. Withdraw your rammer.&#8221; He
was ready at last. He lifted the gun and pointed it horizontally,
pointed it, pulled the ten-pound trigger, and at the
same instant stiffened his body against the powerful recoil.</p>

<p>Then he heard a triumphant roar as the gun went off,
sending its charge of powder and ball in the direction of the
pursuing Yankees. Hooray! Sometimes it merely sparked
and fizzled in the pan. God send he had hit somebody!</p>

<p>&#8220;The Yankees don&#8217;t fire like that, lad,&#8221; he heard a voice
mutter.</p>

<p>Turning his head in surprise, he looked down at a battered
veteran who crouched a few feet away, dabbing at a shoulder
wound.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; he demanded. There wasn&#8217;t enough
of the man&#8217;s uniform left to tell whether he was an officer
or not. Best be safe and address him so. His voice had a ring
of authority, for all it came so weakly from his throat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know.&#8221; The older man smiled through bluish lips.
&#8220;You fire as you were taught, and so do I. Did you ever engage
with the Rebels before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not exactly, sir,&#8221; said Gerry Malory of the Twenty-third.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
&#8220;I&#8217;ve gone amongst them somewhat&mdash;&#8216;incognito,&#8217; one
might say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! Detailed for spy duty, perhaps?&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry felt his face flush. I talk too much, he thought.</p>

<p>The dusk was drawing in thickly now, with a little fog
winding up from the river. Flashes of light burst out on the
road behind him, like fireflies in a hawthorn thicket, all the
way back towards Cambridge where the relief regiments
under Lord Percy were trying to cover the rout of the troops
that had charged so proudly that morning on Lexington
Green.</p>

<p>He heard a whoosh in the dull air behind them. &#8220;Duck,
lads,&#8221; he cried, and flung himself down on the floor of the
cart. The whoosh turned to a shrill whistle and then to a
scream as it passed overhead. Then came a thud and a splash
as the heavy ball fell harmlessly on the sludgy ground.</p>

<p>Gerry lifted his head. &#8220;Drive like the devil, Sergeant,&#8221; he
shouted. &#8220;Once we get over Charlestown Neck, we&#8217;re as safe
as the Tower of London. They&#8217;ll never follow us under the
guns of our own ships.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Causeway&#8217;s just ahead!&#8221; shouted back Sergeant Higgs,
whipping the horses.</p>

<p>Gerry stood up and looked around him. They were well
down on the narrow neck of wasteland now, between the
wide, sea-flowing mouths of the Charles and the Mystic. He
could smell the salt air and feel the cool wind on his hot face.
Groups of weary red-coated men straggled into the marsh
grass to let them drive through. How many had preceded
him into safety, how many were left in the running fight
behind, he couldn&#8217;t tell. But he saw campfires on the smooth
green hills above Charlestown village, and he thought longingly
of the farms and orchards there, a little more longingly
of the Bay and Beagle Tavern and a girl called Sally Rose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>&#8220;Not detailed for spy duty?&#8221; asked the veteran persistently.</p>

<p>Gerry looked down at him, and he was enough of a soldier
to realize that the wounded man wanted to engage in conversation
in order to forget his pain. He seated himself on the
floor of the wagon and answered evasively.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I go about sometimes. I like to know what kind
of men the Rebels are, and what their country is like. Maybe
walk out with a girl and play a prank or two. I be West
Country-bred, and not too fond o&#8217; towns and barracks life.&#8221;
Then he thought of a way to shift the attention to another
matter. &#8220;But what were you saying about the way I shoot?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man grinned. A bit of color had come back into his
face now, and the dark stain was no longer spreading on the
shoulder of his coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, you load and prime your piece and blast away,
hoping the shot will tell. The Yankees sight and aim. I saw
the man who hit me. Stood up behind a stone wall, looked me
over, head to toe, and marked me down. We fire line to line,
and they fire man to man. We shoot in the direction of the
enemy. They pick a target. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;ve got us running
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>You mean they shoot like poachers, thought Gerry. Like
poachers after pheasants in the squire&#8217;s bit o&#8217; woodland. But
he did not say it out loud. Every man&#8217;s past was his own, but
to keep it so, he had to be wary.</p>

<p>They had crossed the Neck by this time, and the road
veered away to the right, circling the foot of Bunker Hill and
heading for Charlestown village.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hear them firing after us any more,&#8221; said Gerry,
peering back the way they had come. Some of the sunset red
was still left in the sky, and enough daylight for him to see
that the road behind them was choked with carts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
stragglers, but the whole pace of the retreat seemed to have
slowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, and you won&#8217;t hear them again tonight. They won&#8217;t
dare follow us into Charlestown. Could you hold me up,
lad? I do not breathe as easily as I am wont to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry knelt down, got his hands under the limp elbows of
the fallen officer, and hoisted him into a sitting position
against the side of the cart. The man drew a few painful
breaths and then spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for your trouble. I am Captain Blakeslee of
the King&#8217;s Own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Twas no trouble, sir,&#8221; muttered Gerry uneasily. &#8220;I be
Private Malory of the Twenty-third.&#8221;</p>

<p>The captain&#8217;s face relaxed in a smile. &#8220;A fine regiment&mdash;the
Welsh Fusileers. I was a guest when they made merry on
last St. David&#8217;s day. Ah&mdash;it comes to me now. I knew I had
seen your face before. Were you not the lad who led forth
the goat with the gilded horns? He ran wild, I remember,
leaped on the table, and up-ended our wine glasses just as
we were going to drink to the Prince of Wales! A ludicrous
scene!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry&#8217;s cheeks grew hot in the darkness, and he clenched
his fists to keep his shame and resentment down. Yes, he had
led the damn goat that according to army tradition preceded
the Welsh Fusileers whenever they passed in review. Led,
and cleaned it, and curried it, and bedded it down every
night in a stable near Long Wharf, and twisted garlands
about its horns on parade days. He still remembered the
hideous embarrassment of the moment when the beast had
escaped him.</p>

<p>Signed up for a soldier, he had, reluctantly, but expecting
his share of excitement and glory. Until today he had done
nothing save tend that black-tempered goat. No wonder he
had fallen into the habit of &#8220;borrowing&#8221; a captain&#8217;s uniform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
or an American&#8217;s homespun breeches and tow shirt, and gone
swaggering out amongst the girls in the Yankee villages now
and then! A man had to have his pride and sweetness and a
bit of sport in life. He had learned to imitate the officers&#8217;
pompous speech and attitudes, or to talk with a New England
twang. Maybe he&#8217;d go for a strolling player when he got
home again. Maybe he&#8217;d be good at it, he thought. But of
course, it was in his blood, and no wonder if he should turn
out that way.</p>

<p>The farm cart ground to a stop just as Gerry was about to
mutter that it was indeed he who led the goat. Sergeant
Higgs leaned over to confer with an officer in fresh white
trousers and trim jacket, a man who had obviously taken no
part in the fighting that day. Then the officer stood aside, the
sergeant pulled sharply on the reins, and Gerry felt the
wagon leave the road and go lurching across a field at the foot
of Bunker Hill. One of the wounded men sat up. The others
began to moan and swear.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re off course, Higgs!&#8221; shouted Gerry, forgetting
that his barracks-mate outranked him and was entitled to a
more respectful salute.</p>

<p>Higgs turned around, his broad face a white blur in the
darkness. &#8220;I be following orders, Private Malory. We&#8217;re to
wait by yon hill till the troops clears a way through the town
so the boats can take us off. By midnight we&#8217;ll all be back in
Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God,&#8221; murmured Captain Blakeslee, and then as
Higgs drew up the cart in a little grove of locust trees, he
turned to the younger man. &#8220;Will you help me down on the
grass for a bit, lad? I&#8217;ve taken a notion to feel the earth under
me. Better under than over.&#8221; He gave a weak smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give us a hand, Higgs,&#8221; called Gerry, trying to lift the
captain, almost a dead weight this time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>Jack Higgs was six years older than Gerry. This was not
his first battle, nor the first wounded man he had seen. The
moment he joined them in the bed of the wagon, he thrust
his hand inside the tattered coat. Then he pulled it out again
and muttered under his breath. For a long moment he stared
at Gerry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is&mdash;is it bad?&#8221; faltered the young private, feeling suddenly
afraid, as he had not felt all that afternoon when the
Yankees were shooting at him as he retreated down the
Charlestown Road.</p>

<p>Captain Blakeslee gave a hoarse cough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad enough,&#8221; said Higgs. &#8220;Tell you what, Gerry. Go
down into Charlestown and see if you can find a surgeon. Tell
him we got need of him here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put&mdash;me&mdash;on the ground,&#8221; whispered Captain Blakeslee.
He lay slumped against the side of the wagon and tried to lift
his head, but he was not strong enough.</p>

<p>Together Gerry and Sergeant Higgs got him out of the
cart and stretched the limp body on the young grass under a
locust tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go quickly,&#8221; Gerry promised. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come back with
the surgeon. I hope &#8217;twill be in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good luck to you, lad,&#8221; said the sergeant. He was still
bending over the wounded man when Gerry hastened off.</p>

<p>The journey proved not to be a long one, but over all too
soon. Ten minutes hard running across the fields, a brief
encounter, and he came pounding back. Jack Higgs stood
leaning against the wagon. He had lighted a little fire of
dead boughs, and in its light his usually pleasant face looked
somber, his eyes a little sick. He was in his shirt sleeves now.</p>

<p>&#8220;They told me I was a fool,&#8221; panted Gerry. &#8220;Told me no
surgeon would come out this far to save one man, or three,
or four, when so many lies bleeding there in the town. How
is the Captain? Jack&mdash;where is your coat?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>Sergeant Higgs motioned toward a dark heap under the
locust tree. For a moment he stood silent, then he spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Surgeons couldn&#8217;t ha&#8217; saved him, Gerry&mdash;not a whole
regiment of &#8217;em marched out here two and two. When I put
my hand to him, his flesh was already cold. He was about
gone. I knew they wouldn&#8217;t come. I only sent you to get you
away. You never been in battle, never seen men die before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your coat&mdash;?&#8221; faltered Gerry. Not that the coat mattered,
but he felt he could not talk of anything that did.</p>

<p>&#8220;I laid it across his face,&#8221; said Higgs, clearing his throat.
&#8220;Afterwards. It seemed more decent-like, somehow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry sat down on the grass beside the little fire, there
being nothing else to do. The moon had risen and was shining
wanly down on the hills and pastures, on the roofs of Charlestown
village. It made a path of silver across the black bay, a
path to the lighted shores of Boston. Lanterns flashed in the
midst of it, lanterns on the prows of the boats that were carrying
the badly defeated British back to the town they had left
so proudly the night before.</p>

<p>Gerry thought how he himself and the rest of the Twenty-third
had marched out that morning, fifers playing &#8220;Yankee
Doodle,&#8221; and colors lifting on the spring wind. They had
marched inland by way of the Neck, through Roxbury to
Cambridge, and so far, it was all a game. But the sport ceased
near Lexington where they met their fleeing comrades who
had gone to Concord to raid the Yankees&#8217; powder magazine.
Powerful grenadiers dropped exhausted and lay like dogs
after a hunt, panting, their tongues hanging out. The Marines
and Light Infantry scattered helter-skelter across the countryside,
while the farmers fired at them from behind every wall
and tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cover the retreat,&#8221; his regiment had been ordered, and
they had done so, in a running battle all the way back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Cambridge. It was there that an officer had detailed him and
his sergeant to help get the wounded away.</p>

<p>And now one of those wounded was dead, Captain Blakeslee.
Why should it matter to him, when he had known the
captain such a little time? But it did matter. A lump swelled
and stiffened inside his throat. Then he looked down towards
Charlestown and thought of Sally Rose. But she wouldn&#8217;t be
there, of course. She had gone to visit her kin in a town called
Newburyport, a town in the country somewhere. Her father
had sent her away because he thought she was too good for
a captain of the Welsh Fusileers. And if he felt that way
about a captain, how would he feel about the private who
tended a goat in stable and led it out on muster day? How
would Sally Rose feel if she knew the truth about him? And
then somehow Sally Rose began to dwindle in his mind, and
for the moment she did not matter any more. He remembered
that he had fought his first battle and come out alive,
but Captain Blakeslee was dead, and maybe tomorrow there
would be another battle, and he would be the one to lie under
the locust tree, under some comrade&#8217;s tattered coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Open your haversack, lad,&#8221; said Sergeant Higgs, his voice
cheery again. &#8220;I found a spring on the hillside a bit of a ways
off, and I&#8217;ve been fetching water to the men in the wagon
there. They be all somewhat easier now, and the boats will
have us in Boston before long.&#8221; He threw another armful of
dry branches on the fire. &#8220;You&#8217;ve salt pork and bread, like
the rest of us, so eat up your supper. &#8217;Twill taste little worse
for the fact that good men be dead, and we lost the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know we were driven back,&#8221; murmured Gerry, obeying
the sergeant and taking out his small parcel of food. &#8220;But
didn&#8217;t the troops get the Rebel stores they went for? Didn&#8217;t
they get to Concord before...?&#8221;</p>

<p>Higgs nodded. He had run the point of his bayonet through
a lump of thick, greasy-looking meat and held it over the fire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
&#8220;Oh, they got there, all right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But they&#8217;d been
better off if they&#8217;d stayed in barracks, according to the way I
heard. They broke up a couple of cannon, rolled some powder
kegs into a millpond, and burnt a house or two. Then they
was routed. But &#8217;twould be a different story if the Yankees
would come out in the open and fight like men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They seemed to be in an almighty rage about something,&#8221;
said Gerry, beginning to toast his own meat, keeping his eyes
away from the shadow under the locust tree. &#8220;And they had
no sort of uniformed army. Men in shirts and leather breeches,
just as they&#8217;d come from the plow or workshop. Well, all
spring we&#8217;ve been sure there was fighting ahead of us. Now
it&#8217;s begun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jack Higgs, looking out at the dark shapes of
the rescue boats that crossed and recrossed the moonlit water.
&#8220;It&#8217;s begun, and it took two to begin it&mdash;we and they. But at
the end&mdash;there&#8217;ll be left only one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it better be we!&#8221; Gerry felt his own features soften
in a smile.</p>

<p>He put up his head in the sharp night air and heard the
bugles sounding on the peaceful green crest of Bunker Hill.
They were British bugles, and they reassured him. For the
last hour or so, he had been sure he would never have the
heart to go forth disguised and playing pranks about the
countryside again. But now it seemed to him that perhaps he
might.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Four</i><br />


<small>THE COURAGE TO GO AND THE
FEET TO GET HIM THERE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Not</span> that way, child!&#8221; cried Granny warningly. &#8220;Lord
o&#8217; mercy, Sally Rose, take care!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose stood by the huge brick fireplace in the raftered
kitchen and stared desperately about her. In her hands she
held a hot iron kettle full of molten silver-gray lead. It was
too heavy for her to hold any longer, and she saw no place
to set it safely down. Kitty would have figured out ahead of
time what she meant to do with it, but not Sally Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me help you,&#8221; cried Kitty, jumping up from her
place at the heavy oak table where she had been preparing
the bullet molds while Sally Rose heated the lead. She
reached her cousin&#8217;s side a second too late. The kettle tilted
dangerously and fell from Sally Rose&#8217;s loosened fingers,
just missing the yellow flames beneath. It lay on its side at
the edge of the wide hearth, its contents spilling out harmlessly
in a gray film over the rosy old bricks, sinking into the
cracks between them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Gran,&#8221; said Sally Rose contritely.</p>

<p>Granny sniffed. &#8220;Sorrow butters no parsnips,&#8221; she retorted.
&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s no use crying over spilt lead, I suppose. That&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
one batch of bullets will do no harm to the British. But it&#8217;s
a mercy you didn&#8217;t burn yourself or set the house afire.&#8221; She
straightened her muslin cap and smoothed her plaid apron
with thin, blue-veined hands.</p>

<p>Kitty let her glance rove out of the window, at the gooseberry
bushes in the kitchen garden and the moist brown
seedbeds where Timothy had been spading yesterday. His
old hickory-handled spade still leaned against the garden
wall. No telling when he would use it again. Timothy had
taken his gun and gone to Cambridge, and it seemed like half
the town had gone with him. Even boys not much older than
herself, boys like Johnny Pettengall. She still didn&#8217;t know
about Dick, but then, Dick didn&#8217;t have a gun, so he&#8217;d probably
be down at the shipyard, just as he always was. She&#8217;d make
some excuse to go by there, later in the day. She wondered
about the strange lad from up the Merrimack. Maybe, since
the war was in Massachusetts Colony, the New Hampshire
men would think they had no call to go. Still, with his keen
eyes and sharp jaw, he looked like he&#8217;d be wherever there
was a fight going on. She heard Granny&#8217;s brisk voice calling
her attention back to the kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;d better run down to the gunsmith&#8217;s, Kitty,
and fetch me some more pig lead&mdash;all he can spare. Sally
Rose, you and me&#8217;ll get the bake ovens going. Uncle Moses
Chase came by here awhile back, and he says they&#8217;re gathering
supplies to send by oxcart&mdash;enough to feed the lads for
a few days: hams, flour, meal, salt fish and cooked victuals;
lint and medicines, too, in case&mdash;who told you to take your
apron off, Sally Rose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I&#8217;d better go with Kitty?&#8221; asked Sally
Rose eagerly. &#8220;Lead&#8217;s apt to be heavy, you know, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What she can&#8217;t carry, the shop will send after her, I don&#8217;t
doubt,&#8221; replied Granny. &#8220;Sally Rose, you start yourself for
the flour barrels. Take half rye and half cornmeal....&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Sally Rose pouted. Kitty knew she was pouting, although
she did not look at her. She tied on her new chip hat with the
velvet roses, and hastened through the garden, into the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kitty, take off that hat and put on your old serge hood!&#8221;
Granny called after her. &#8220;It looks like there&#8217;ll be a shower
any minute.&#8221; Kitty pretended not to hear her.</p>

<p>She walked down the hill into the town, past Mr. Dalton&#8217;s
mansion house and the Wolfe Tavern. People still loitered
about in little groups, but last night&#8217;s excitement seemed to
have given place to a quieter mood, uneasiness, anxiety, perhaps
fear. The shoemaker stood in front of his gabled shop,
a wooden last in one hand and a strip of purple kid in the
other, talking to a grizzled old man who peddled clams in
Water Street.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, we&#8217;ve heard no more,&#8221; he was saying. &#8220;No more o&#8217;
the Concord Fight, or our lads that marched away. Whole
colony&#8217;s up, though. Half Essex County&#8217;s gone, the stage
driver says, and the men way out west beyond Boston are
moving in from their side. Hope to squeeze the British in
between.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said the peddler. &#8220;The Hampshire lads has started
across the river, too. Some by ferry, and some with smacks
and dories, and they say there&#8217;ll be more. The word&#8217;s gone
inland, way beyond Rockingham.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean they&#8217;re going to make cause with us and fight
the King&#8217;s men?&#8221; asked the shoemaker, twisting the strip of
purple kid in his hand.</p>

<p>The peddler nodded. &#8220;They&#8217;ve long been sworn to. And
everywheres now, them as was undecided whether to go
Whig or Tory has got to make up their minds. You&#8217;ll find
things&#8217;ll be different, now blood&#8217;s been spilt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty walked on, and the words echoed disturbingly in her
head. The street sloped sharply down to the water, with shops
along both sides&mdash;the milliner&#8217;s, the baker&#8217;s, the butcher&#8217;s&mdash;shutters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
down and doors wide open, just as on other days, but
nobody seemed to be buying anything. Most of the shopkeepers,
like the shoemaker, had joined the uneasy groups
in the street outside.</p>

<p>The gunsmith&#8217;s shop was in a narrow lane behind the
church, and when she reached it, she found its door tightly
barred and a crude sign dangling from the latch. <i>Gorn to
Cambridj till further notiz</i>, the sign said.</p>

<p>She stood there uncertainly for a moment, and looked
about her. The soft gray sky seemed to match her own mood,
uncertain whether to pour down rain or let the sun shine
through. Between the houses she could see the waters of the
river, a darker gray. Not all the men had followed the gunsmith&#8217;s
example, for busy crews were working about the
wharves and slips, hammers rang from the shipyards, and
the tall chimneys of the distillery lifted their plumes of
smoke, just as if it were an ordinary morning. Somehow the
sight reassured her. She&#8217;d go and look for Dick, she thought,
and make sure that he hadn&#8217;t run off with the Minutemen.
Then she&#8217;d go home and tell Gran about the gunsmith, take
off her hat, and get ready to help with the baking.</p>

<p>As she passed the sailors&#8217; boardinghouse in Chandler&#8217;s
Lane, she noticed Eben in the backyard chopping wood, and
she called to him. He straightened up, looked at her for a
minute, then put his ax down and came over to the board
fence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you after, Kitty? &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t no use looking for
Dick,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I was looking for Dick,&#8221; said Kitty
tartly, chagrined because Eben had read her mind so plain.
&#8220;But now that you speak of him, I don&#8217;t suppose he&#8217;s off
for Cambridge, too?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben nodded solemnly. &#8220;Ye-a, Dick&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>Kitty felt shocked in spite of herself. &#8220;But how could he?
He doesn&#8217;t have a gun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got a tomahawk,&#8221; said Eben. &#8220;Tomahawk they
took out o&#8217; his great-grandmother&#8217;s head when the Indian
tried to scalp her up in Haverhill in &#8217;96.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I know that old thing,&#8221; cried Kitty. &#8220;It&#8217;s duller&#8217;n
a hoe. We played with it when we were children. Might as
well try to fight with a warming pan!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eben shrugged. &#8220;Colonel told him to come along,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Told him there&#8217;d be men there was poorer armed, he
didn&#8217;t doubt. Said the courage to go and the feet to get him
there was all he&#8217;d really need.&#8221; Suddenly he fell silent. He
looked down at his own bare feet and stubbed one great toe
in the moist earth.</p>

<p>Kitty felt a little shaken. So Dick had gone off to fight
the British. Dick, that she&#8217;d played with when they were
toddlers and he lived in an adjoining house on High Street.
How excited they had been, that day when they first found
out they were big enough to scramble back and forth over
the low fence. And now he had taken his old tomahawk and
marched away, a man with other men! And she was left here
to do Gran&#8217;s bidding, just as if she were still a little girl. But
she did not feel like a little girl. She felt sad and tremulous
and excited, as if she had the weight of the world on her
shoulders, and still, a little happy in spite of it all. Maybe
this was the feel of growing up. Maybe last night when they
played hide-and-seek had really been their last night to
be young, though they hadn&#8217;t known it then. Mostly, she
thought, we never know when we do anything the last time.</p>

<p>She suddenly realized that a soft rain had begun to fall,
cooling her checks and gathering mistily in her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eb&mdash;en!&#8221; shouted a buxom woman from the back steps
of the boardinghouse. &#8220;Take in my washing off the line!
Step lively there!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>Eben muttered, and his face burned crimson as he walked
away.</p>

<p>Kitty looked after him for a moment, and her heart stirred
with quick sympathy. It must be hard for Eben to be left
behind to do such humble chores while his friend had gone
off to war and been accepted as a man. The soft drizzle
turned into a downpour. She thought, belatedly and with
some alarm, of the roses on her hat. She turned and hurried
back to Market Square and up the hill, walking with her head
bent because of the rain, trying to shield her finery with one
lifted hand. So it was that she did not see him until they
almost collided under the tavern sign that hung on a long
pole high over the sloping street. Then she caught her breath
and stepped back, and looked up into the eyes of Tom Trask,
the logger from Derryfield.</p>

<p>He stood there, bareheaded in the rain, and he wore the
same hunting shirt and moosehide breeches, but he was not
smiling now, though his gray eyes lighted with recognition.</p>

<p>&#8220;Playing games on the dock tonight, Miss Kitty?&#8221; he asked
her, and in spite of his sober face, his voice had a teasing note
in it.</p>

<p>She smiled and shook the rain from her lashes. &#8220;How did
you know my name was Kitty?&#8221; she asked him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Heard &#8217;em call you that times enough&mdash;last night, I
mean, whilst I was looking on.&#8221; His eyes smiled now, but
his mouth remained a thin line. He seemed to be waiting
for her answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not often so silly, and besides, I
doubt if the rain will stop. And even if it did&mdash;there are
hardly enough of us left to play.&#8221;</p>

<p>He nodded. &#8220;I seen two o&#8217; your friends marching off last
night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All our crew was asleep on the raft when
the bells begun to go, but when we got into town and heard
the news, &#8217;twas no surprise. I was over to Johnny Stark&#8217;s sawmill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
just before I started down river, and he said he figured
Boston had stood about all they could o&#8217; the British, and the
British had stood about all they could o&#8217; Boston. Said he expected
to be taking his gun down any day. Well, if he&#8217;s got
the word, he&#8217;s likely there, him and the rest o&#8217; the boys, and
I aim to join them, only&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty could feel her hair turning dank and the raindrops
thickening on her lashes. She thought of her sodden hat, and
sighed inwardly, but she made no move to excuse herself and
leave the stranger.</p>

<p>&#8220;&mdash;only I left my musket at home in Derryfield, and the
gunsmiths here ain&#8217;t doing business today. Has any o&#8217; your
menfolk got a spare gun, Miss Kitty?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated. He held out his lean hard hands with
freckles on the backs of them. &#8220;I suppose I could use these
on the varmints,&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;But powder and ball&#8217;s the
quicker way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a gun in the barn loft that belonged to my
father,&#8221; she said slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak like your daddy&#8217;s dead,&#8221; he answered, not
looking at her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He drowned in the river just below here, not long
after I was born.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember much o&#8217; mine, either. Killed when we
took Quebec in &#8217;59. Shooting shoulder to shoulder with the
British then we was, and now we&#8217;re shooting at &#8217;em.&#8221; He
shrugged his lean shoulders. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;d sure like to borrow
your daddy&#8217;s gun, if your mother don&#8217;t object none to the
idea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother&#8217;s dead, too, and Granny would likely make
a fuss, but I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll ask Granny.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty had finally made up her mind. &#8220;Come on,&#8221; she said,
flicking her fingers lightly against his sleeve.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>His fingers were not light when they gripped her arm.
They were sure and steady. Together they walked up Fish
Street and turned right to pass the Frog Pond and the new
training green. He strode proudly along with his head up,
but he did not talk to her. Instead he whistled a plaintive air
she had never heard before.</p>

<p>When they got to Gran&#8217;s neat clapboarded house, she
guided him through the front gate and along the garden
path, half screened by lilac bushes growing thick and tall.</p>

<p>A small whitewashed barn stood at the rear of the property,
but Granny kept no livestock any more, and the inside of it
smelled clean and musty like an attic, with no scent of dung
or hay. The loft had two tiny windows set high under the
eaves, but no other light, and it took Kitty a few minutes
before she could make out the old gun hanging on the wall
between a moth-eaten lap robe and a long wooden fork for
pitching hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; she murmured, pointing, breathless and a
little proud.</p>

<p>He strode forward and pulled down the short, thick-barreled
gun. When he spoke she caught a note of dismay
in his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;An old blunderbuss,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;An old blunderbuss!
Looks like the one Adam must ha&#8217; carried when they
driv&#8217; him out o&#8217; Eden.&#8221; He peered into the flaring muzzle.
&#8220;Might shoot, at that. Don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll try it in here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Groping around on a shelf, Kitty found an empty powder
horn, which he took a little more gratefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;ll be powder enough where I&#8217;m going,&#8221; he told
her, &#8220;and I better be getting there.&#8221;</p>

<p>The rain tapped steadily on the shingles overhead, but the
tiny window that faced westward showed a streak of blue sky.
Carrying the old blunderbuss carefully, he moved toward
the ladder that led below. Uncertain what to do or say, Kitty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
stood and stared at him. He paused and turned toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take good care o&#8217; this,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll see you get
it back when I don&#8217;t need it any more.&#8221; He took a step in
her direction. Suddenly her throat began to hurt, and she felt
as if she were going to cry. He took another step. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make
sure of it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When I get to camp and can set down
for a spell, I&#8217;ll cut your name and the town where you live&mdash;right
here on the butt.&#8221; He tapped the end of the thick gun.
&#8220;And then, maybe somebody else will send it home if I don&#8217;t&mdash;come
back this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>He took her by the shoulders and kissed her quickly on
the mouth.</p>

<p>She gulped and felt the tears slip down her cheeks. Under
his hands her shoulders were shaking.</p>

<p>&#8220;But I aim to come back,&#8221; he said. He scrambled down
the ladder and away. Like Dick, he had the courage to go
and the feet to get him there, and she was left without so
much as a window to wave him good-by from, and how
could he put her name on the gun when he did not know her
name?</p>

<p>It came to her suddenly that she had to run after him and
tell him her name was Catherine Greenleaf. If he didn&#8217;t
know it, he&#8217;d never be able to send her father&#8217;s gun back to
her, and she wouldn&#8217;t want a stranger to keep her father&#8217;s
gun. Dashing the tears away, she stumbled down the ladder
and ran through the lilacs where she met him slowly coming
back. He looked down at her and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come to my mind that a thing you do for luck, you must
do three times,&#8221; he said. He bent and kissed her again. Then
he turned and ran through the front gateway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop, thief!&#8221; yelled Granny, tapping furiously on the
parlor windowpane. &#8220;That&#8217;s my son&#8217;s blunderbuss! Call the
watch! Call the constable! Call the sheriff! Stop, thief, stop!
Come back, come back!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Five</i><br />


<small>THE GREAT IPSWICH FRIGHT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;I &nbsp;can&#8217;t</span> think whatever put you up to such devilment,
Catherine,&#8221; sputtered Granny. &#8220;&#8217;Twas bad enough for
you to spile your new hat, without giving your father&#8217;s gun
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve told you over and over again that I didn&#8217;t give him
the gun,&#8221; sighed Kitty. &#8220;I only loaned it to him. He promised
to bring it back. He looked like a lad who&#8217;d keep his word.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny clucked to the raw-boned sorrel horse and tugged
expertly at the reins as the animal plodded round a curve in
the sandy road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom, Tom, the piper&#8217;s son/He ran away with Father&#8217;s
gun!&#8221; sang Sally Rose under her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hummp!&#8221; snorted Gran.</p>

<p>Kitty looked across the plowed fields to where the Merrimack
flowed behind a hedge of willows. They dipped their
long green boughs in the flooding stream, and here and there
the water gave back a flash of bright sun. How peaceful everything
looked in the soft April afternoon. How hard it was
to believe that the lads she knew might be facing the redcoats&#8217;
bayonets only a few miles off. But everyone did believe it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
Everyone was frightened and apprehensive. Folk turned out
everywhere to shade their eyes and watch the roads that led
southward, Boston way.</p>

<p>It was more than twenty-four hours since Tom Trask had
made off with the old blunderbuss, but Granny was still scolding
about it. She would have scolded more, probably, if there
hadn&#8217;t been so many chores for all of them, getting supplies
ready to send after the Minutemen. All day yesterday they
had baked, and this morning she and Sally Rose had gone
from door to door collecting old linen for bandages. Then
Uncle Moses Chase brought the borrowed wagon and suggested
that the three of them might help by driving into the
country to see what they could procure from the cellars and
smoke houses of the farmers round.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d let it go to one o&#8217; the Port lads&mdash;say Dick
Moody, now&mdash;I could have understood,&#8221; Granny rambled
on. &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know how many years that gun has been
in our family! My grandmother told me it was brought from
England in the days of the coming over. Her father got it
in trade for an old horse down in Plymouth County.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty gave a sudden giggle. &#8220;Tom said it looked old enough
to belong to Adam,&#8221; she said. She pulled her bonnet off and
felt the warm sunlight on her brown hair, felt a warmth
inside her when she said his name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hoity-toity, so we call him &#8216;Tom&#8217;!&#8221; cried Granny.</p>

<p>Sally Rose reached out and caught her grandmother&#8217;s
ruffled taffeta sleeve. &#8220;Granny,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there&#8217;s a farmhouse
down that cart track under the shagbark trees. Uncle
Moses said to call at every place and not miss a single one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty gave her cousin a grateful glance as Granny turned
the sorrel off the highway and into a rutted lane. Stone walls
bordered the fields on each side of them, and little brooks of
water flowed in the gutters, draining the wet black land. In
one field a plow stood abandoned in mid-furrow, and half a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
dozen cows waited patiently at the bars, but nobody came to
drive them off to pasture.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be anyone at home,&#8221; said Granny, &#8220;&#8217;Bijah Davis
lives here, and he&#8217;d never treat his animals so.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they drove into the yard of the weathered farmhouse,
a young woman came to the door, a pale young woman with
a baby in her arms and two toddlers pulling at the skirts of
her blue calico dress. A half-grown yellow cat ran between
her feet, almost upsetting her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Land&#8217;s sakes, Nance,&#8221; cried Granny. &#8220;You&#8217;re looking
poorly this spring. Is &#8217;Bijah round somewhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young woman shook her head. &#8220;&#8217;Bijah took his gun
and put for Cambridge,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I wrapped him up
a clean shirt and a hunk o&#8217; corn&#8217; beef. I don&#8217;t know when
he&#8217;ll be home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny tut-tutted. &#8220;Many gone from around here?&#8221; she
wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty nigh all the men,&#8221; said the young wife sadly.
&#8220;Like you say, Ma&#8217;am Greenleaf, I been poorly this spring,
but I got both bake ovens going just like other folks, I can
tell you. We&#8217;re cooking up victuals to send after the lads.
Two oxcarts has gone already, and by tomorrow we can fill
two more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Granny nodded in agreement. &#8220;We&#8217;re doing the same at
the Port,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t suppose you got any foodstuffs
you could spare us, something you don&#8217;t need for your own?&#8221;
She pulled out a beaded purse and fingered it significantly.</p>

<p>Nancy Davis put up a hand to smooth back the stray wisps
of hair from her forehead. &#8220;Could be some eggs in the
haymow where the hens steal nests sometimes,&#8221; she murmured.
&#8220;Could be. I ain&#8217;t had the gumption to go look.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go,&#8221; cried Sally Rose eagerly. &#8220;Come on, Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take this basket,&#8221; said Gran, reaching under
the wagon seat. &#8220;And don&#8217;t be gone long. It&#8217;s nigh on to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
sunset time. When we finish here, we&#8217;ll start home.&#8221; She
turned again to the farm wife. &#8220;I suppose folks is pretty well
stirred up around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young woman nodded. &#8220;That we be. Nervous and on
edge till we&#8217;d run a mile if we was to hear a pin drop. Fear&#8217;s
about us on all sides, just the way I&#8217;ve heard my grandmother
tell it was down to Salem in the witchcraft time. It&#8217;s because
we don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening, I think&mdash;nothing since the
first word. Sure, the British was driv&#8217; back to Boston once,
but maybe they&#8217;ve marched out again. Maybe our lads
couldn&#8217;t stop &#8217;em, and they&#8217;re headed this way. And how can
I tell whether &#8217;Bijah be still in the land o&#8217; the living or no!&#8221;
She began to cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Folks is all upset at the Port, too,&#8221; said Gran soothingly,
getting out of the cart to go to Nancy.</p>

<p>The girls scurried into the mossy-roofed rambling barn,
climbed to the loft, and began searching through the hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;Which are you the most worried about, Kit,&#8221; asked Sally
Rose. &#8220;Dick, or&mdash;?&#8221; She sneezed violently and wiped her
eyes and nose with a lace handkerchief. &#8220;My, this hay dust
makes me think of the time when I was little and got to
playing with Father&#8217;s snuffbox. Which one? Tell me, Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m worried about all of them,&#8221; said Kitty slowly. &#8220;Even
your wretched Gerry. I wish men would keep their guns for
deer and wild ducks. I don&#8217;t see why they have to kill each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose shrugged. &#8220;I know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t understand
it either. But you have to realize, Kitty, some things
about men we&#8217;ll never understand.&#8221; She pulled a large brown
egg out of the hay and placed it carefully in the basket. &#8220;I
wonder,&#8221; she said thoughtfully, &#8220;if the men on both sides
were all shut up in gaol, just how the women would go to
work to settle the matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Kitty, adding two more eggs to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
collection, &#8220;but I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;d be cups of tea for everybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tea doesn&#8217;t have much to do with this war, Father says,&#8221;
went on Sally Rose quickly. &#8220;And Gerry says the same. They
both say it&#8217;s to decide who will rule America&mdash;King and
Parliament, or the men who live in this country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think King and Parliament would have enough
to do at home,&#8221; answered Kitty. &#8220;What&#8217;s that? I thought I
heard someone shouting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both girls sat up in the shadowy mow to listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn out! Turn out! For God&#8217;s sake!&#8221; thundered a
hoarse voice from the highway.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s brought news of the lads,&#8221; cried Sally Rose,
upsetting the basket in her haste to scramble down the ladder.
Forgetting the eggs, Kitty followed her. They ran out of the
barn and across the yard under the hickory trees. Granny and
Nance, with the children straggling after them, had already
started up the lane.</p>

<p>A black-coated rider came spurring toward them from the
direction of the Port, waving his cocked hat with one hand
and whipping his horse with the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn out!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Turn out, or you will all be
killed! The British have landed at Ipswich and have marched
to Old Town Bridge! They are cutting and slashing all
before them!&#8221;</p>

<p>He paid no attention to the huddled group of women, but
galloped past.</p>

<p>&#8220;Turn out! Turn out!&#8221; he panted. &#8220;The British have
landed at Ipswich!&#8221; His voice grew fainter as he rounded
the end of a low hill and swept out of sight.</p>

<p>They stood looking at one another. &#8220;If you ask me, his
wits are addled,&#8221; said Gran stoutly. &#8220;He had a mad look in
his eyes. I&#8217;d want some further word&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a chaise hurtled down the road, swaying from side<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
to side, driven by a lean woman with gray hair streaming
about her shoulders and a swansdown hat hanging on one
ear. &#8220;The British!&#8221; she choked as the chaise went rocking by.</p>

<p>After her came a young couple on horseback, and then
three farm wagons loaded with family groups and household
goods. A wooden churn fell off and rolled into the brimming
gutter, but they did not stop to retrieve it; they drove furiously
on.</p>

<p>Nance stood there, as silent and rooted to earth as one of
her own hickory trees. Kitty and Sally Rose held hands
tightly and looked at each other, uncertain whether to laugh
or be afraid, waiting to see what would happen next.</p>

<p>Then it seemed as if half the Port went streaming by. Gran
stood at the side of the road and waved her beaded purse at
the mad rout of chaises and wagons, but nobody would stop
for her. Finally a farmer hastened by on foot, leading a plow
horse that had gone lame. She stepped up smartly and caught
him by the front of his tow-colored smock. &#8220;Young man,
what is the meaning of this?&#8221; she demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;God Almighty, are ye deaf, Mother?&#8221; he growled, spitting
tobacco juice into the dust of the road, just missing her
dainty kid slipper. &#8220;The British ha&#8217; come ashore. Come
ashore at Ipswich, and hacked their way past Old Town
Bridge. I rode over twenty dead bodies as I come from there.
They&#8217;ll be at the Port now, heading this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the first time Kitty began to feel that this was not
some ridiculous mistake. Her throat grew tight, and her
nerves began to tingle with fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is everyone going?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>The farmer turned to answer her. &#8220;They&#8217;re all trying to
get across the river into Hampshire,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Some&#8217;s for
the woods and swamps nearby. Better get along yourselves.
You&#8217;ll be the safer, the further you can go.&#8221;</p>

<p>He urged his old horse forward again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>Gran turned back from the highroad as another half dozen
wagons rattled past. &#8220;He looked like an honest lad, and he
saw it with his own eyes, Nancy,&#8221; she admitted reluctantly.
&#8220;You bundle up the children and whatever food you&#8217;ve got
on hand, and come along in our wagon. I&#8217;m going to drive
as hard as I can for Haverhill Ferry. I trust we&#8217;ll get across.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nance, bewildered and numb with terror, tried to follow
out Granny&#8217;s instructions. Back in the kitchen she fumbled
through the bin, brought out a sack of potatoes, and stood
there helplessly, holding it. Gran reached past her. &#8220;Take
the apples, instead,&#8221; she advised. &#8220;They&#8217;ll taste better if we
have to eat them raw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Finally the young wife got herself, the two children, and
the shawl-wrapped infant into the wagon. She sat on the seat
with Granny, and Kitty and Sally Rose crouched on a sack
of turnips a farmer had given them early in the afternoon.
How long ago that seemed! In the gathering twilight they
drove swiftly along the winding river road.</p>

<p>The lower Merrimack Valley above the Port was not
sparsely settled country in those spring days of 1775. There
were farmhouses and parish churches and crossroads villages
scattered all about it, and few dwellers there who could not
see their neighbor&#8217;s chimney smoke or the lights of his kitchen
when they looked out at night. But now the peaceful district
was overrun with strangers and refugees streaming through.</p>

<p>Kitty and Sally Rose huddled together on the turnip sack
for warmth, looking back down the road every now and then,
to see if the British were in sight, if the glare of burning towns
lighted the sky. But all they could see were the frightened
folk of Essex County hurrying for the swamps and the forests,
for the low hills of New Hampshire Colony across the
wide dark stream.</p>

<p>Women, and a few old or feeble men, were toiling across
the farmyards here and there, carrying favorite gowns, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
chests of silver, or pewter teapots to conceal them in wells
and hollow trees. And from almost every doorstep strong
arms laboriously hoisted old folk and invalids into carts to
haul them away.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think&#8217;ll come of it, Kit?&#8221; asked Sally Rose
in a low worried voice. &#8220;Do you think Gran will take us over
the river to Haverhill? I don&#8217;t want to go to Haverhill. It&#8217;s
a sleepy country town, and it&#8217;ll be worse than the Port, with
all the lads away. I&#8217;d almost rather get caught by the British,
I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they&#8217;re cutting and slashing all before them,&#8221; Kitty
reminded her grimly. &#8220;That farmer said he rode over twenty
dead bodies on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do not think they would cut and slash me,&#8221; said
Sally Rose, smiling confidently in the dark. &#8220;Oh, Kit, look
there!&#8221;</p>

<p>They were passing a tiny cottage half hidden by leafy apple
trees. An armchair had been placed firmly on a scrap of lawn,
and in the chair sat a man with a lantern beside him and a
musket across his knees. He was enormous, and almost perfectly
round. &#8220;Let the British come!&#8221; he shouted, and waved
his musket. &#8220;I be too fat to budge for &#8217;em! I&#8217;ll stay here and
shoot the bloody devils down!&#8221;</p>

<p>A little way farther on they came across a group of women
bending over another woman who lay on the ground in the
curve of a stone wall. Granny hesitated, and then drew rein.
&#8220;Is the poor critter sick?&#8221; she called to them. &#8220;Can I help?
Perhaps we could make a place for her.&#8221;</p>

<p>A tall woman in a gray shawl straightened up. &#8220;No,
thank&#8217;ee, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; she called crisply. &#8220;It&#8217;s only Aunt Hannah.
She wheezes so with the asmaticks, her noise would give
us away to the British. We&#8217;re going to cover her over with
leaves and let her rest, all snug and out of sight, here by the
wall.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>At that Nancy Davis began to laugh. She laughed and
laughed, and then she began to cry. Gran slapped her face
hard and drove on. &#8220;None o&#8217; that foolishness, Nance,&#8221; she
said severely. &#8220;Mind your children. &#8217;Bijah would expect you
to. Kitty and Sally Rose&#8221;&mdash;she lifted her voice&mdash;&#8220;is all well
with you back there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not go any farther, Gran,&#8221; pleaded Sally Rose.
&#8220;There are lights at the inn we just passed by. If the folks
haven&#8217;t run away, maybe they&#8217;ll have beds for us. Maybe
if we hide in bed, the British will ride on and never know
we&#8217;re there. I don&#8217;t want to go to Haverhill, Gran.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When I say you&#8217;ll go to Haverhill, to Haverhill you&#8217;ll
go,&#8221; said Gran, and drove on into the night. &#8220;I hope I can
make the ferry in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty sensed the note of anxiety in Gran&#8217;s voice, and that
frightened her more than anything that had gone before it.
Not when the smallpox struck and folk lay dying in every
house in town, not when a great tree crashed through the roof
in the midst of an autumn storm, had she known Gran to feel
afraid. She looked over her shoulder again, and then around
her at the dark fields, the thickets here and there along the
road. Frightened women had come this way in other times,
she knew, when Indians with tomahawks lurked behind every
tree. She had heard, too, of the dreadful times at Salem that
Nancy spoke about, when the devil had walked abroad in
Essex County, or folk thought that he had, though they never
saw the devil. The most terrible fear, she thought, is the fear
of an unseen thing. A British Army marching toward them
with drums and banners and bayonets would not be so terrible
as the shadows that might hold any nameless menace, the
shadows drawing closer in....</p>

<p>She turned to Sally Rose, but Sally Rose was humming a
little tune. There was boredom rather than terror in her hazel
eyes. Sally Rose had found one redcoat to be a gallant and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
handsome lover, so she believed they would all be that. But
Kitty had heard tales of their cruelty to Boston folk. She
remembered that blood had been shed at Concord Fight and
on Lexington Green. She crouched on the turnip sack and
shivered with cold fear.</p>

<p>Somehow the road seemed to be less crowded now. No one
had passed them for half an hour. Then they met a little
group of horsemen slowly riding back. Granny hailed them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you headed for Newburyport? Is the battle over?
Where are the British?&#8221; she wanted to know.</p>

<p>The leader took off his cocked hat, and Kitty noticed that
he had a bald head and very black eyes. &#8220;We begin to think
the British are in Boston and have been there all along, that
they never stirred from there. We have found no trace of
them, and we scoured the countryside. The whole commotion
is either a sorry jest or a coward&#8217;s error, it seems. At least,
we have recovered sufficient courage to ride back toward
Ipswich and see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suspected as much,&#8221; said Gran, tightening her mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ho hum!&#8221; said Sally Rose.</p>

<p>The men rode off, and Gran pulled the wagon to one side
of the road. They were facing a small common with a white
steepled church at the edge of it. Houses clustered round
about, darkened and deserted, their doors hanging open, their
inhabitants fled away. Overhead the elm boughs tossed eerily
in the light of the cold moon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out, girls, and stretch your legs,&#8221; Gran ordered.
&#8220;Then I&#8217;m going to turn around and drive back to my own
house at the Port. You can come with me, Nance, if you&#8217;re
afraid to bide at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid any more,&#8221; said Nance wanly. &#8220;Not if the
British are still in Boston. Do you think they are still in
Boston, Ma&#8217;am Greenleaf?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel sure of it,&#8221; declared Gran firmly. &#8220;Well, the Bible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
says the young men shall dream dreams. That&#8217;s what that lad
who said he rode over twenty dead bodies must ha&#8217; done.
Let&#8217;s all go over to the church steps and give thanks to God.
Dream, joke, or error, I don&#8217;t care which it was. It&#8217;s over
now, and high time we went home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two children were asleep on the seat of the wagon,
but Nance carried the shawl-wrapped baby and held it in her
arms as they knelt on the church steps of gray old stone. Gran
lifted up voluble thanks to the Almighty, and Kitty&#8217;s attention
wandered. She watched a husky youth who had been
hiding in the crotch of a pear tree climb sheepishly down and
sidle off, gnawing a piece of salt pork. He had apparently
taken provisions to his refuge, in case the British kept him
treed for a long time. The sight of the pork made her hungry,
and Nance must have seen it, too, and thought of food, but
not for herself. The minute Gran rose from her knees, she
asked if they could wait while she suckled the baby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why of course,&#8221; said Gran heartily. &#8220;My, there&#8217;s not
been one peep out of the little thing. I trust it hasn&#8217;t got
smothered in all this uproar.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nancy sat down on the step, carefully pulled the shawls
away, and bent her head while the others stood looking on.</p>

<p>Suddenly she screamed. They peered closer.</p>

<p>&#8220;God save our souls alive!&#8221; gasped Granny.</p>

<p>Sally Rose giggled. Kitty swallowed and made no sound
at all.</p>

<p>In her haste Nance had wrapped up the wrong creature,
and now it was the half-grown yellow cat that slept peacefully
in the crook of her arm.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Six</i><br />


<small>FUN WHILE IT LASTED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> young man sat on the steps of the tavern by Ipswich
Green and stared about him; at the old brown roofs
with yellow moss growing on their seaward sides, at the little
rocky river that flowed like liquid amber under its stone
bridge, at the steepled church on the rocky hill. Shadows lay
long in the deserted streets of Ipswich, and far to the west
the sun was going down.</p>

<p>The young man wore a rough woolen shirt and homespun
breeches. He had a cleft chin, deep blue eyes, and black curly
hair. He looked uncommonly pleased about something.</p>

<p>The landlord came to the open doorway behind him and
stood there, peering into the dusk. He was a short plump
man with a lame leg and a worried expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a sign o&#8217; the British yet, be there, lad?&#8221; he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>The young man shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Could be they&#8217;ve
turned aside and gone another way,&#8221; he said in a lilting tone.
&#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll be taking the road myself, while there&#8217;s
a bit o&#8217; the daylight left. How far did you tell me it was to
Newburyport, sir?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>The landlord shifted his feet uneasily. &#8220;It&#8217;s a piece of a
journey yet, and the roads will doubtless be clogged with
fleeing folk, if one&#8217;s to judge by the rout that streamed out
of here; likewise the half o&#8217; Beverly tagging through. Why
not stay the night? I&#8217;ll give ye free lodging. It&#8217;ll mean there&#8217;s
one able-bodied man in town, besides a handful of petticoat
folk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the young man shrugged his shoulders. &#8220;Well
enough, if &#8217;twill please you&mdash;and supper be included in the
offer.&#8221; He got to his feet and stood there smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in, lad, come in,&#8221; cried the landlord in relieved
tones. &#8220;Come, and I&#8217;ll give ye supper, such as &#8217;tis. Cook&#8217;s
run off to the hills like all the rest, but my daughter Nanny&#8217;s
here, and Nanny can do. Come and bring your box, if ye will.
Where&#8217;d ye say ye be from? Have ye traveled far?&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man stooped and lifted a small leather chest
bound with iron. Deep in the lid was burned the name
&#8220;G. Malory.&#8221; It was a peculiarity of his that although he
often played other men&#8217;s parts and wore other men&#8217;s clothing,
he would never abandon his own name.</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnstaple,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Gerry Malory of Barnstaple, shoemaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Barnstable? Down Cape Cod, ain&#8217;t it? A fair ways from
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Barnstaple&#8217;s a fair ways off,&#8221; said the young man.</p>

<p>Together they stepped into the dark smoky taproom. It
was deserted except for a little maid, scarce more than a child,
who stood in the doorway of the kitchen.</p>

<p>The landlord went to the hearth and stirred the dwindling
fire. &#8220;What&#8217;s in the pot, Nanny?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dandelions,&#8221; said Nanny pertly. &#8220;Dandelion greens and
a ham bone. But the ham bone don&#8217;t smell like it should,
Father.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>&#8220;Warm up the chowder then,&#8221; he ordered, and turned to
his guest. &#8220;Are ye handy with firearms, Gerry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a pistol in my chest here, among my shoemaker&#8217;s
tools. Guess I know what to do with it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; cried the landlord impatiently. &#8220;I got no faith
in such pop guns. I mean a man-sized weapon. Son Rob took
my musket to Cambridge, but there&#8217;s a fowling piece hung
up on the kitchen wall. I don&#8217;t see as well to aim as I did
once. Who was it spread the word about town? Did ye happen
to hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>The shoemaker shook his head. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t say, sir. As I
told you before, I was just passing through here on my way
to Newburyport to see a girl, when all at once a great stir
began, and folks went rushing to the green. Somebody
shouted that the British had landed at Ipswich Bar and were
cutting and slashing all before them. Next thing I knew, the
wagons started rolling out of town, and everyone took to the
highway, afoot and on horseback. I watched them for awhile,
and then came here to catch my breath and maybe have a
bite of supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again the landlord went to the door and peered nervously
into the thickening night. &#8220;Not a light in town,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Folk that hasn&#8217;t fled away be keeping their houses dark,
&#8217;twould seem. Do ye mind if I don&#8217;t light up, lad? Can ye
see by the glow o&#8217; the fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis no trick to find a mouth the size of mine,&#8221; said the
young man gallantly. Then as Nanny put a steaming bowl
on the table in front of him, his nostrils quivered. &#8220;Did the
ham smell stronger than this, my lady?&#8221; he asked her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Nanny flatly, stepping back into the kitchen.</p>

<p>He sat down on a bench, picked up a ladle, and tasted the
chowder gingerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;None for me, Nanny,&#8221; called her father. &#8220;I be that
worried about the British, I wouldn&#8217;t relish victuals none.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>&#8220;Right, sir,&#8221; said Gerry, putting down the ladle. &#8220;It comes
to me that I, too, am worried about the British. Still, a piece
of bread now&mdash;it need not have butter&mdash;I could eat it dry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slice up a loaf of bread, Nanny,&#8221; called the landlord.</p>

<p>Nanny&#8217;s thin piping voice came back from the kitchen.
&#8220;The bread&#8217;s moldy. All that wasn&#8217;t, we sent to Cambridge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry Malory sighed resignedly. &#8220;Well, perhaps a glass
of milk then&mdash;unless all the cows have fled away. Nothing
stronger. I must keep a clear head on me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlord himself brought a pitcher of milk and poured
two glasses full.</p>

<p>&#8220;Be ye just up from the Cape, Gerry? And did ye come
by Cambridge? We&#8217;ve had no news from there since the
word o&#8217; Concord Fight come through.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man shook his head. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t been near
Cambridge, and it&#8217;s a long time since I went Barnstaple way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where ye been, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;round Charlestown most of the time, I guess. You
know Job Townsend&#8217;s tavern there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Job Townsend? Keeps the Bay and Beagle, don&#8217;t he?
In Crooked Lane near Harvard Street. I knowed him when
he was your age. Too bad. He lost his wife young. Got a
right pretty daughter, I&#8217;ve heard. Sally Rose, or something
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s got a pretty daughter,&#8221; said Gerry Malory,
draining his glass. &#8220;I been around the Bay and Beagle some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t get down that way much myself,&#8221; said the landlord
thoughtfully. &#8220;What&#8217;s the news thereabout? Do they
think the British&#8217;ll fight? And if they do....&#8221;</p>

<p>The young man shook his head solemnly. &#8220;You got no
chance against the British,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The landlord looked up sharply. &#8220;Ye say &#8216;you&#8217; and not
&#8216;we,&#8217;&#8221; he protested. &#8220;Does that mean Barnstable don&#8217;t intend
to join against the cruel laws o&#8217; the King? That they be not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
with the rest o&#8217; Massachusetts? The Hampshire towns be
with us, and I hear that so be the west and south, New York
and Virginia, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, no, I do not mean that at all,&#8221; cried the young
shoemaker. &#8220;&#8217;Twas a slip of the tongue. Of course Barnstable&mdash;on
Cape Cod&mdash;will join cause with you. I only mean that
the outlook is dark, sir, dark, for those who would fan the
flames of rebellion in America.&#8221;</p>

<p>He put down his empty glass and leaned forward, his
hands clenched before him on the table. &#8220;How can <i>we</i> defend
a thousand miles of seacoast with only a few scattered towns,
against a great battle fleet of three hundred ships and armed
men? We can scarce put thirty thousand soldiers in the field.
England has one hundred and fifty thousand, and can summon
more. We lack guns, ammunition, money, and trade.
More than that, we lack the tradition of love of country, a
tradition that will make the meanest man fight and die
bravely. For a thousand years men have been giving their
lives for England. What man has ever given his life for
America before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like you been listening to some Tory make
speeches, lad. Happens there was a few gave their lives at
Concord and Lexington the day before yesterday,&#8221; retorted
the landlord. &#8220;There&#8217;s a first time for everything, Gerry.&#8221;
His voice was milder than the milk in his half-empty glass,
but his eyes held a sharp look, a look of question. Suddenly
his face went white.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lord in heaven, I&#8217;ll fetch the gun for ye! Here they
come!&#8221; he cried, dashing from the room, tripping over a
footstool unseen in the light of the fire.</p>

<p>Gerry Malory lifted his head. He heard a shouting in the
road, the creak of wagons rumbling along. He, too, got up,
went to the door, and stared out into the soft April night.
The moon had not yet risen, but as he turned to look to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
north he could see swaying lights and shadowy figures, moving
painfully slow, but drawing closer. He waited, silent, to
see what would emerge out of the dark.</p>

<p>As the cavalcade became more sharply visible, he saw that
it consisted of three oxcarts piled with boxes, kegs, and
baskets, escorted by some half dozen men. The oxen lumbered
along wearily, and the men seemed weary, too, as they
plodded at the side. They were not young men, but grayish
and old and frail, except for a thin-faced lad with tow-colored
hair and an ancient gun gripped casually in his right hand.
The wagons drew to a halt in front of the tavern, one man
stayed with the oxen, and the others came forward eagerly,
seeking refreshment.</p>

<p>Gerry stepped back into the taproom and turned to face
the landlord who rushed out of the kitchen with a badly
rusted gun held in front of him. &#8220;No British,&#8221; he said reassuringly.
&#8220;Just some teamsters who want to wet their whistles,
I expect.&#8221; He retired to the shadows near the great chimney,
found a stool there, and sat down.</p>

<p>The landlord bustled forward to welcome the visitors. In
a few moments they were seated at the table, and Nanny was
helping her father to set out food and drink, greens, ham
bone, chowder, and all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a fit man amongst us,&#8221; sighed the oldster with a face
like a russet apple and a scar across his forehead. &#8220;I fought
in too many wars already. But once we get these stores to
Cambridge, likely I&#8217;ll stay there and enlist for one more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know how we&#8217;d ha&#8217; got this far, if this Hampshire
lad hadn&#8217;t o&#8217;ertaken us,&#8221; said another. He turned to the thin-faced
youth who was eating chowder, the old blunderbuss
leaning against the table close to his elbow. &#8220;We was sure
glad to see you, Tom Trask, when our cart broke down the
other side of Rowley last night. A proper wheelwright you
turned out to be.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>Tom Trask did not look up from his chowder. &#8220;Be a wheelwright
when I have to,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;or most any other
sort of thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, lads,&#8221; questioned the landlord eagerly, &#8220;did ye
see aught of the British that&#8217;s supposed to be marching on us,
cutting and slashing all before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We heard the rumor, o&#8217; course,&#8221; went on the russet-cheeked
man, &#8220;and saw the rout go past. Didn&#8217;t trouble us
none. We kept on our way. Word&#8217;s gone about now, that
there be doubts the British ever was nearer than Boston.
Truth to tell, sir, I surmise we been made fools of.&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlord made a clucking sound with his thin lips.
Tom Trask was staring hard at the small iron-bound leather
box on the table in front of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s that there belong to?&#8221; he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&mdash;oh, that belongs to Gerry Malory over in the
corner. Gerry&#8217;s a shoemaker from Barnstable&mdash;on his way to
Newburyport to see a girl.&#8221; The landlord&#8217;s voice was gay
and jovial in his relief, now that he had no further cause to
fear the British. After all, he had not fled away at the false
rumor. He had not been made a fool of. He strutted a little
as he walked about the room, filling the glasses, replenishing
the fire. When his shame-faced neighbors came straggling
back, he&#8217;d be able to indulge himself in a boast or two. Then
suddenly he pricked up his ears. The tow-headed lad from
New Hampshire Colony was speaking. He held the leather
chest in his hands, turning it about.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;G. Malory,&#8217; it says here. And Landlord says G.&#8217;s for
Gerry. Gerry Malory&mdash;going to Newburyport to see a girl.&#8221;
He sounded thoughtful.</p>

<p>The landlord noticed that the young shoemaker from
Barnstable had edged his stool further back into the shadows.
He said no word.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>&#8220;Seems to me,&#8221; went on Tom Trask, &#8220;I might know what
girl he&#8217;s going to see. A peacock-proud girl named Sally
Rose, I wouldn&#8217;t wonder. Seems to me I heard o&#8217; Gerry
Malory.&#8221;</p>

<p>His voice deepened, and there was a sharp edge to it that
caught the attention of everyone in the room and made them
listen.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s her!&#8221; cried the landlord excitedly. &#8220;Sally Rose!
Job Townsend&#8217;s daughter! He said he hung around the Bay
and Beagle some!&#8221;</p>

<p>Still the young man in the shadows did not speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Gerry Malory I heard of,&#8221; went on Tom Trask,
&#8220;was said to be a captain in the Twenty-third. That&#8217;d mean
he&#8217;s a British officer.&#8221; He waited accusingly.</p>

<p>The landlord slapped his thigh. &#8220;Well, pickle my brains
in rum!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;I think ye be right, lad. He was talking
like a Britisher just before ye got here. Saying times was dark
for us, and no man would give his life for America. Out o&#8217;
that corner, sir, and answer the charge! Be ye a lobsterback
come in disguise among us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then indeed Gerry Malory stepped forward. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
mistaken yourselves,&#8221; he said easily. &#8220;There may be a man
with the same name as mine in the ranks of the British. I
doubt that I be the first Gerald Malory since the world was
made. I doubt if I be the last. I be a shoemaker of Barnstable,
loyal as any man here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Loyal to what?&#8221; demanded Tom Trask. Then he bent
down, pulled off one crude cowhide boot, and held it out.
&#8220;Here. I got a hole clear through my sole leather tramping
these rocky roads of Essex County. If you be a shoemaker,
prove it! Cobble my boot!&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry Malory took the boot in his hands and examined
it. Then he shook his head. &#8220;&#8217;Tis scarce worth fixing, my
good man,&#8221; he said condescendingly. &#8220;Get yourself a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
pair when you arrive in Cambridge. That is the best advice I
can give you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lie,&#8221; said Tom Trask steadily. &#8220;I can fix it myself, if
you&#8217;re unable. All I ask you to do is prove you be a shoemaker.&#8221;</p>

<p>The teamsters, the landlord, even Nanny, were staring in
silence at the two young men. Gerry Malory studied the boot
in his hand. He frowned. &#8220;Well enough,&#8221; he said. He
opened the small chest and fumbled inside it, took out a
wooden last, hammer, and awl, a packet of pegs and nails.
&#8220;Ah, this should do it,&#8221; he murmured judiciously. He selected
a strip of leather and tried to fit it over the ragged hole
Tom had pointed out.</p>

<p>All eyes were upon him. No lips made any comment. He
gripped the boot with one hand under the instep. He fitted
the leather over the hole with the other hand. Then he stood
there, conscious suddenly that he had no third hand to set the
nails in place, no fourth hand to wield the hammer. He put the
boot down and started all over again.</p>

<p>But his face was growing hot and his fingers even more
clumsy. Suddenly he ceased his efforts. &#8220;I am sorry,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I forgot my most needful tool. You must wait until you get
to Cambridge, unless you can find another cobbler.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Trask stood up. He held the old gun lightly in his
hand. &#8220;Your most needful tool is there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but you
don&#8217;t know enough to know it. Put the boot on the last, you
should have. That would ha&#8217; held it firm, and left your
hands free to get on with your cobbling. Right enough, we&#8217;ll
go to Cambridge, and we&#8217;ll take you along as our prisoner,
Captain Malory o&#8217; the Twenty-third. All the world can see
you&#8217;re no shoemaker. Johnny Stark will know what to do
with you. Landlord, have you a length of rope, or better, a
few links of chain, about the place? For safety, we&#8217;ll tie him
up now.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Gerry Malory, of Barnstaple in English Devon, bit his
lip and stared around him somewhat wildly. That cursed
Yankee with the gun that looked as if it came out of Noah&#8217;s
ark stood between him and the open doorway. He doubted
if it would shoot, but even if it didn&#8217;t, its owner looked like
no easy man to handle. And the Yankee had his friends
about him.</p>

<p>While he hesitated, two old men ambled forward and
bound his wrists together with a heavy length of clanking
chain. Then they stepped back, and the whole company continued
to stare at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Captain,&#8221; said Tom Trask thoughtfully, &#8220;I be not so
sure as I was that you come this way to see a girl. Likely you
did, but likely, too, you might ha&#8217; spread the false report that
the British was upon us. It might ha&#8217; been a word o&#8217; yours
that sent us flying over hills far and wide as if the devil was
after. A fool&#8217;s prank, maybe&mdash;maybe a smart trick to spread
confusion amongst us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Gerry Malory remembered the scenes of the
afternoon: lean spinsters rocking along like giraffes in the
animal garden on Tower Hill, fat men waddling off, their
faces red and their eyes popping with panic. He laughed
aloud and looked down at his hands bound stiffly in front of
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;In either case, it was fun while it lasted,&#8221; he said.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Seven</i><br />


<small>OFF TO THE WARS IN BOSTON</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Cousin,</span> I see no future for us in this place,&#8221; said Sally
Rose bleakly.</p>

<p>She was sitting in the soft grass on the hill behind the Frog
Pond, looking down the dusty street that led through the
Port, straight to the wharves and warehouses along the river.</p>

<p>Kitty pulled herself up on her elbow and let her glance
follow her cousin&#8217;s. There appeared to be as many white sails
in the channel as usual, the same blue spring haze on the far
shore, and the familiar curve of sky overhead. But the town
below them, commonly bustling with life on a warm May
afternoon, looked strangely deserted and still. A brown dog
slept in the middle of High Street, and two old men hobbled
past the Wolfe Tavern in the direction of Market Square. A
farm cart ground its slow way towards Old Newbury, and a
group of children ran hither and thither across the training
green with laughter and shrill cries.</p>

<p>Kitty pulled a golden dandelion blossom from the grass
and began to tear it apart in her fingers. &#8220;I think I see what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
you mean, Sally Rose,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is dull here with no one
to talk to but grown folk&mdash;and of course, the other girls. I
never realized how many girls there are in town. There
never seemed to be so many before. I never thought I bothered
myself much about the lads, but what a difference it
makes&mdash;now they are all gone away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gone, and not likely to return very soon, from what I
hear,&#8221; said Sally Rose thoughtfully. &#8220;A few have come home,
but mostly the older men with families, or the fainthearted
ones. Last night I heard Uncle Moses telling Granny they
plan to stay where they are and form a mighty army that will
circle round like a wall of iron to keep the British penned in
Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then there&#8217;s no knowing when they&#8217;ll be home,&#8221;
answered Kitty. It made her uneasy to admit to herself, as
she had been forced to do, that all her eagerness and anxiety
were not for her long-time friend, Dick Moody, but for that
other one, the thin lad from New Hampshire who had taken
her father&#8217;s blunderbuss away.</p>

<p>&#8220;No knowing,&#8221; agreed Sally Rose. &#8220;Three weeks it&#8217;s been
since Concord Fight, maybe more. More than a month since
I&#8217;ve seen Gerry. I thought he might write to me, but he never
has. Some of the Tory girls in Boston are very fair,&#8221; and she
sighed. &#8220;I thought I might find someone to take his place,
but I should have known I never could&mdash;here in this dull,
stupid, country town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re better off not seeing him, since he&#8217;s British,&#8221; said
Kitty sharply. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure, most times, you&#8217;d find better lads
than him, walking down Queen Street any day. But just now&mdash;well,
you know where they&#8217;ve all gone. They&#8217;ve gone to
fight for the rights of our colony, and you ought to be proud
of them, Sally Rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ummmm,&#8221; said Sally Rose, chewing a dandelion stem
and then making up a face when its bitter white milk puckered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
her mouth. &#8220;Of course I&#8217;m proud of them. How old
does one have to be before they&#8217;re an old maid, Kitty? It
seems like I might be approaching the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no,&#8221; cried Kitty. &#8220;We&#8217;re only sixteen. No one would
think that of us&mdash;not for at least two years more!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose stood up and tossed her bright hair in the sun.
&#8220;Two years isn&#8217;t long,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Well, you can sit here in
the Port and wither if you want to, but I&#8217;ve got other fish in
the pan.&#8221;</p>

<p>She started walking quickly in the direction of Granny
Greenleaf&#8217;s weathered house.</p>

<p>Kitty watched her with apparent unconcern for as long as
she could. Then she jumped to her feet and hurried after.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; she panted.</p>

<p>Sally Rose smiled at her. &#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go
back to my father&#8217;s house in Charlestown. If there&#8217;s a war in
Boston, we&#8217;ll be in the midst of everything there. Why don&#8217;t
you come along, Kit? Tom Trask may not be back this way,
you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty felt her face turning hot and red, but she chose to
ignore the last part of her cousin&#8217;s remark. &#8220;You can&#8217;t go to
Charlestown,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Granny won&#8217;t let you go where
there&#8217;s likely to be fighting. You know that as well as I.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had turned in at the front gate now, and were walking
under the budded lilac bushes, Sally Rose in the lead,
Kitty following breathless, a few steps behind.</p>

<p>&#8220;A fig for Granny!&#8221; cried Sally Rose. &#8220;I love her, of course,
but she&#8217;s a timid old lady, fit only to huddle in the chimney
corner. She doesn&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like to be bold and daring&mdash;the
way a girl has to be these days. Of course she won&#8217;t let
me go, and so I shan&#8217;t ask her. She drove out to see Nancy
Davis this afternoon. When she gets back at suppertime, I
won&#8217;t be here. I&#8217;ll be halfway to Rowley&mdash;or further on.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>She opened the unlocked kitchen door and ran lightly up
the back stairs to their chamber.</p>

<p>Kitty followed, a little more slowly. She sat down on the
edge of the high four-poster and dangled her feet over the
side; watched while Sally Rose gathered ribbons, laces, and a
few toilet articles and tied them up in a shawl.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a long walk to Charlestown,&#8221; she said tartly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so far for a horse,&#8221; answered Sally Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a horse then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know where to borrow one. I know where I can borrow
two. Uncle Moses Chase keeps half a dozen in his barn on the
Old Newbury road, and he&#8217;s gone with Granny, so he won&#8217;t
know if we take them. He won&#8217;t care, when he finds out.
Why don&#8217;t you come with me, Kitty? We&#8217;ll have a gay time
in Charlestown.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty shook her head, but without much conviction. &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t go behind Granny&#8217;s back,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Sally Rose smiled sweetly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry you feel so, Cousin.
Perhaps I do wrong to make a jest of everything, but that is
my way. Have you never thought, when you hear all these
preparations for war, that there is work for us as well as for
the lads? Who&#8217;s to cook and wash and sew for them, and bind
up their wounds when the fighting is over? I&#8217;m going where
I can be of use to my country. If you&#8217;re afraid to come with
me&mdash;well, you can stay here and sleep in the sun by the Frog
Pond every afternoon. You&#8217;ll surely be safe enough&mdash;unless
a horsefly bites you, or the dry rot settles in.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took a quill pen and inkpot from the mantelpiece, sat
down at the dressing table, and began to write.</p>

<p>Kitty jumped from the bed and took a few turns up and
down the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you really think we ought to go, Sally Rose?&#8221; she
asked. &#8220;Do you think&mdash;we might be needed there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly do think so,&#8221; said Sally Rose. &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
to pack any clothes, Kit. At home in Charlestown I have more
than enough for two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Under Sally Rose&#8217;s urging, Kitty opened a top drawer in
the old mahogany chest and began slowly to sort out the few
possessions she wanted to take with her, if she did go; an
ivory comb, a pleated linen fichu, her mother&#8217;s cameo brooch.
Her fingers flew faster every minute, as her heart warmed to
the plan.</p>

<p>Her throat grew tight, and she felt tears of eagerness and
excitement sting her eyelids. She was going to serve her
country, like Tom and Johnny and Dick, and all the Newburyport
lads, all the lads of the Bay Colony, and maybe
other colonies, too. She was going to take part in a serious,
and a mighty, and a very grown-up thing. Wars were history,
and she was going to help make history. It had been done
before by other girls who were just as young. She was glad,
she thought, that she was to have a chance to do it in her time.
Her heart stirred just as it did in church when one or another
of the old warlike hymn tunes rose on the air.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take a cloak, Kit, for it&#8217;ll grow cold after
sundown, and we may ride late,&#8221; advised Sally Rose, pulling
her own fleecy shawl from the carved old press. &#8220;Come, let&#8217;s
be off to the wars in Boston!&#8221;</p>

<p>On her way to follow Sally Rose&#8217;s bidding, Kitty caught
sight of her cousin&#8217;s note as it lay open on the dressing table.</p>

<p><i>Dear Granny</i>, the note began, in dainty, pointed script,
<i>Forgive me for leaving you so suddenly, and practically forcing
poor Kitty to go along. But I dare not travel by myself,
and I find that a sudden yearning to see my father takes
me....</i></p>

<p>Kitty stood still for a moment and almost gave up all idea
of this desperate journey.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have a gay time in Charlestown.&#8221; &#8220;I want to serve
my country.&#8221; &#8220;A sudden yearning to see my father takes me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>Sally Rose could give many reasons for what she wanted
to do. And she would always give the ones most likely to get
her what she wanted. And what was her true reason? No one
knew except Sally Rose.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Kitty found she did not turn back, but
folded her cloak over her arm and hastened downstairs after
her cousin. After all, what was her own reason for wanting to
go to Charlestown? She did want to serve her country, but
she was quick enough to see that she could serve it quite as
well at home, if she had chosen so. But she had not so chosen.
Was not she, Kitty, slyer, more secret and stubborn than
Sally Rose in getting her own way?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It was black dark when they rode into Ipswich, very few
lights in the town, and very few people still awake. The moon
was hidden away behind the clouds somewhere, and a light
mist had begun to fall.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped we could get as far as Beverly,&#8221; said Sally Rose,
&#8220;but we&#8217;ve come only half the way. Uncle Moses said he had
plenty of horses in his barn, but he didn&#8217;t say they were plow
horses. Well, there&#8217;s a light in the tavern. I&#8217;ve stopped there
before, and I know the landlord&#8217;s daughter. A pert, homely
little wench, but I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll find us a bed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so,&#8221; said Kitty dubiously, climbing down from her
horse and following her cousin up the wide stone steps and
through the low front door.</p>

<p>The taproom smelled of cider and fish and the smoky
wood fire burning on it blackened hearth. It was dimly lit and
empty, except for three old men who sat at a table with
glasses in front of them, and a sharp-faced, sallow girl polishing
other glasses behind a narrow bar.</p>

<p>When Sally Rose walked across the uneven floor, her head
up, her eyes shining in the candlelight, her hips swaying ever
so slightly, the heads of the old men turned toward her as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
sunflowers turn to follow the golden light of day. Kitty
walked demurely behind her, but nobody noticed Kitty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nanny,&#8221; cried Sally Rose, putting out her hand to the girl
eagerly, as if there was no one in the world she would be
gladder to see than Ipswich Nan. &#8220;Nanny, we&#8217;re o&#8217;ertaken
with darkness, and we need a bed for the night, my cousin
and I.&#8221; She drew Kitty forward, and they stood together at
the bar. &#8220;We&#8217;ll need supper, too, Nanny,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Nanny curtsied. &#8220;Yes, Miss Sally Rose,&#8221; she answered,
beaming adoringly at the pretty, smiling face turned toward
her. &#8220;The bed in the east chamber is aired and ready. Should
I serve you there, or....&#8221; She glanced about the taproom.</p>

<p>Sally Rose began to pull off her embroidered gloves, put
up a hand to pat her golden hair. &#8220;Oh&mdash;at that table by the
fire, please. It was chilly, coming the last mile through the
swamp willows, and with all the fog about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nanny lighted a candle in a pewter holder and carried it
to the table by the fire. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bring you supper right off, Miss
Sally Rose. We got dandelion greens and a ham bone&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose made up a face. &#8220;Oh Nanny,&#8221; she pleaded,
&#8220;you know my stomach&#8217;s delicate.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty clapped her hand over her mouth so that she would
not giggle. Sally Rose had never been sick in her life, and
could probably digest brass nails if she had to.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t you find a bit of chicken, Nanny?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Chicken I&#8217;ve not got,&#8221; answered Nanny. &#8220;But there&#8217;s a
piece of spring lamb I just been a-roasting for the minister&#8217;s
wife. She&#8217;s got Salem company coming tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lamb will do nicely,&#8221; said Sally Rose, sitting down
at table.</p>

<p>&#8220;About our horses,&#8221; asked Kitty, taking the chair across
from her cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course. I&#8217;ll speak to one of the men and have them
seen to. I noticed the landlord as I came in.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>They turned to look at the three men by the table. The
men were all staring at them and talking together in low
voices. One of them now rose and came forward. He wore
a leather apron tied around his middle and walked with a
decided limp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Job Townsend&#8217;s daughter, ain&#8217;t you?&#8221; he demanded of
Sally Rose. &#8220;Visit kin in Newburyport on occasion?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose smiled and dimpled. &#8220;Why, how clever of you
to remember me! Of course I&#8217;m Job Townsend&#8217;s daughter,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;And I&#8217;m on my way home from Newburyport
right now. I&#8217;ve often told my cousin Kitty here, about your
tavern&mdash;there isn&#8217;t a better one in the whole of Essex
County.&#8221;</p>

<p>Strangely enough, the landlord was not smiling at Sally
Rose, and he ignored her compliment.</p>

<p>&#8220;We had a young fellow here a short time back. A young
fellow who said he hung around the Bay and Beagle some.&#8221;</p>

<p>He waited, his face expressionless, for Sally Rose to speak.
In the silence Kitty heard the rattle of dishes from the
kitchen. She caught the delicious odor of roast meat, the tang
of crushed mint leaves.</p>

<p>Sally Rose&#8217;s smile grew no whit dimmer. &#8220;We&#8217;ve many
young fellows who hang around the Bay and Beagle,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;My dad would go poor, if we didn&#8217;t. They keep the
till full. Did he tell you his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>The landlord spoke accusingly. &#8220;He said his name was
Gerry Malory. He said he was going to Newburyport to see
a girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose shrugged her graceful shoulders. &#8220;Plenty of
girls in Newburyport,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know this Gerry Malory?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I might,&#8221; she answered cautiously. &#8220;Was he a dockyard
hand now, or maybe a farmer from Breed&#8217;s hill&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This one was took up for being a British officer,&#8221; said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
landlord grimly. &#8220;Took up, right here in my tavern. Irons
put on his wrists&mdash;part of an old ox chain I had&mdash;and he was
took to the camp at Cambridge under guard. Likely they&#8217;ll
hang the damn redcoat. I hope they do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose&#8217;s smile looked a bit frozen, but it did not vanish
away. There was a tremor in her voice, but she spoke imperiously
still. &#8220;All very interesting, Landlord, but your daughter
has undertaken to fetch us a supper of spring lamb. We
are tired with long riding, and if you could ask her to be spry
about it, we should be grateful. Our horses, also, are at your
door and in need of attention.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down and turned her back upon him.</p>

<p>Kitty watched the lame man shake his head. Then he
stumped off toward the kitchen. She looked again at her
cousin, and Sally Rose&#8217;s eyes were shining with more than
the candlelight.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was coming to see me,&#8221; she murmured happily.
&#8220;Gerry was coming to see me when they caught him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty felt her face twist in a frown and spoke her disapproval.
&#8220;Which he shouldn&#8217;t have been doing, of course. He
belongs with the other British in Boston. Well, he&#8217;s got himself
in trouble now. A prisoner of our men, and the landlord
talked of hanging. Aren&#8217;t you worried about him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose took off her bonnet and shook back her shining
hair. &#8220;Not a little finger&#8217;s worth,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They won&#8217;t
hold him long. He can come and go like a breath of east
wind, Gerry can. My, oh my&#8221;&mdash;and she patted the front of
her muslin gown&mdash;&#8220;I&#8217;m so hungry. I wish Nanny would
hurry and bring that spring lamb!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Twenty-four hours later they were hungry again, much
hungrier, and very tired. But they were riding down Crooked
Lane in Charlestown, with the Bay and Beagle almost in
sight, and over the river the lights of Boston.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>&#8220;My, it&#8217;s been a tiresome day,&#8221; sighed Sally Rose. &#8220;Losing
my purse, horse going lame, taking the wrong turn in Danvers&mdash;I
don&#8217;t see how I could have been so stupid as to do
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The black flies were the worst,&#8221; complained Kitty. &#8220;I&#8217;m
bitten in a dozen places, I vow. And I don&#8217;t dare scratch the
bites, for if I do, I&#8217;ll look as if I had smallpox.&#8221;</p>

<p>She thought back over their long day&#8217;s riding: village
greens with white steeples&mdash;Wenham, Beverly, Salem; long
stretches of salt marsh with the sea beyond it; then Lynn and
Malden, as the towns drew closer in. It was already night
when they came to Medford, and there a constable had
ridden with them through town, straight to the Penny Ferry.
Part of the great New England Army was camped on the
hills about and overflowing the streets and taverns, he said,
and he feared for the safety of young maids abroad so late.
What were their folks thinking of, anyway?</p>

<p>For once Sally Rose had been too tired to be charming.
She bowed her head meekly and accepted his rebuke. But her
spirits rose as they left river and causeway behind them and
took a field path so as not to have to pass the Sign of the Sun
tavern where there were apt to be British officers about.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but Daddy will be surprised,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I want a
glass of Spanish wine and a meat pasty. And then, bed! Oh
Kitty, think what it&#8217;ll be like to have a featherbed under us
again! I swear, I&#8217;ll roll and wallow in it! Why&mdash;why here
we are, and there aren&#8217;t any lights in the windows!&#8221;</p>

<p>They drew up their horses uncertainly in the deserted
street. All the houses were dark around them, and the cloudy
sky was dark overhead. A lantern burned at the top of a pole
a little way off, so that Kitty could make out the weathered
sign before her uncle&#8217;s tavern, the wooden profile of a tall
bay horse pawing the air, and at his feet a trim, alert hunting
dog. But as Sally Rose said, the diamond-shaped panes were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
dark. Peering closer, however, she noticed some letters traced
in whitewash on the iron-bound door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look, Sally Rose, there&#8217;s a sign, but I can&#8217;t read it,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>They got down from their horses and walked closer.
&#8220;Neither can I,&#8221; said Sally Rose. She tried the door. It was
locked tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know how to climb in by the buttery window,&#8221; she
murmured, for once a little crestfallen, &#8220;but I still want to
know what is written on the door. I wonder where Father can
be. He always keeps late closing time.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood irresolute a moment. Then she drew a quick
breath as if something pleased her, and ran down the street
to the lantern swinging on its pole. Reaching, stretching,
pulling herself up, she managed to lift it down and hurry
back, holding it proudly aloft, flashing it on the paneled door.</p>

<p>In the light that flared uncertainly behind the thin panes
of horn, the two cousins bent close and read aloud the words,
&#8220;Closed. Gone to the wars till the damn British be beat. J.
Townsend.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood still and looked at each other. A salt-smelling
wind blew down the old street, and a wisp of fog came with
it. Fog was dimming the lights of Boston, that even now,
close to midnight, still burned on the other side of the river.
The lights looked unfriendly, Kitty thought, as she remembered
that Boston was in the hands of the enemy. Down by
the wharves men were shouting and the shouts had an angry
sound. A burst of musket fire broke out, somewhere off Medford
way. The girls looked at each other and shivered. They
were hungry and tired and fly-bitten. They were a little
frightened, maybe.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will we do now?&#8221; asked Kitty. The tone reminded
Sally Rose that she was to blame for the plight they were in,
even if the words did not.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>&#8220;I&mdash;don&#8217;t&mdash;quite know,&#8221; faltered Sally Rose. &#8220;We can
get into the house. We&#8217;ll have a roof over our heads, and a
bed to sleep in. Maybe there&#8217;s something to eat in the cupboard.
We&#8217;ll be safe for tonight. But it&#8217;s after that I&#8217;m thinking
of. We can&#8217;t run the tavern alone, without father, and
how are we to live if we cannot run the tavern?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We could send for Gran,&#8221; said Kitty a little mockingly.
&#8220;Of course she&#8217;s a timid old lady, but I notice she&#8217;s able to
do most everything that comes her way. I&#8217;ll bet she&#8217;d be able
to serve up cider, or rum toddy, or hot grog&mdash;or whatever it
is they drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Sally Rose was smiling again. &#8220;Kitty, that&#8217;s a
wonderful plan. Let&#8217;s climb into the house now, and have
supper, and sleep forever. When we wake up we&#8217;ll send her
a letter by the first post. The buttery window&#8217;s around here
at the back, under the apple tree. Come along. I can unfasten
the catch, but you&#8217;ll have to hoist me in.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Eight</i><br />


<small>SAVED BY A PIPE-SMOKING MAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Standing</span> in the wet salt grass at the end of Chelsea Neck,
Tom Trask shifted the old blunderbuss from one shoulder
to the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wisht I had my own gun,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather
try to lug a young pine tree, roots and all, than this critter
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he smiled sheepishly as he thought of the pretty girl
who had loaned him the aged weapon. She was a pretty girl,
too. Likely he&#8217;d go to her house and see her when he went
down river with the logs next spring. Guess she wouldn&#8217;t
have any eyes for the Newburyport lads when he was about.
This fuss would all be over by then, and folks back where
they belonged, plowing their own ground.</p>

<p>He shivered with the cold that goes before sunrise and
tried to peer through the blackness and mist around him to see
if the others were getting as restless as he. There were three
hundred or more of them, New Hampshire and Massachusetts
men, here where the Neck narrowed down. Not a torch, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
a lantern, General Putnam had warned, and if any man felt
the need of tobacco, let him cut plug and chew, like an old
cow with cud. It was worse than being lost in the devil&#8217;s
pocket, but even at that, it was better than sitting around
camp playing cat&#8217;s-cradle, like they&#8217;d been doing for the past
month. A man could get gray whiskers before his time, that
way.</p>

<p>Some of the lads who came a-running so quick after Concord
Fight had got tired of the game and put for home already,
but Tom hadn&#8217;t quite been able to convince himself he
ought to go along. No, so long as Colonel Stark saw a reason
to sit around waiting for the British to jump, he guessed he,
Tom Trask, could wait too. He himself hadn&#8217;t been far from
the camp at Medford, but he&#8217;d heard Boston was all ringed
round with Massachusetts and Connecticut men keeping the
redcoats shut up tight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you hear me, lads?&#8221; bellowed a gruff voice up ahead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; came a dozen shouts from the tall reeds around
him, and an equally gruff voice added, &#8220;Aye! We be listening
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Volunteers! Old Put wants volunteers!&#8221; roared the first
speaker. &#8220;There&#8217;ll be an officer come amongst you. There&#8217;ll
be....&#8221; His voice grew fainter as he turned to deliver his
message in another direction, but the words still sounded
plain.</p>

<p>Tom put his blunderbuss down and leaned on it. He spoke
to the man who stood in the marsh grass just ahead of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got any idea what this is about?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>The other man took his time in answering. He was older,
Tom sensed, and more heavily built. In the silence they
heard shouting and the rattle of musket fire. A ship&#8217;s gun
flashed on the dark waters of Chelsea Creek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yea&mdash;a,&#8221; said the man slowly. &#8220;I was down by the ferry
stage awhile back.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>&#8220;Was there fighting there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fighting there was. The British ships firing at us, and
our men waist-deep in water shooting back&mdash;even the General
himself, Old Put.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you hear what the volunteers be for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe. You haven&#8217;t been here all along? You&#8217;re one o&#8217;
the reserves who come in late last night? One o&#8217; Stark&#8217;s
men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye. One o&#8217; Stark&#8217;s men, and proud of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man was chewing tobacco, Tom&#8217;s keen nose told him.
He spat suddenly into the reeds, his own mouth tasting rancid.</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely some day you may have something to be proud of.
You done no more yet than anyone else, as I can see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom ignored the rebuke. &#8220;Volunteers now,&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;If I knew what &#8217;twas about, likely I might take a
notion to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely they wouldn&#8217;t want you,&#8221; sneered the older
man. &#8220;If I was Putnam&mdash;which I ain&#8217;t&mdash;I&#8217;d give the job to
one o&#8217; the Essex County boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because &#8217;tis a seafaring operation, of a sort, and there be
none like the Essex men for maneuvers at sea.&#8221;</p>

<p>The firing from the river was steady now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;What is this operation that takes
such a picked crew? I never see salt water yet will fight a man
as hard as old Merrimack when the freshets come down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Volunteers!&#8221; sang out a voice nearby. A man, bareheaded,
wearing a torn brown coat, stood before them holding
a carefully shielded lantern in his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleven picked men I got. I need one more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Twelve men, you got,&#8221; said Tom, shouldering his blunderbuss.
&#8220;Where do I go?&#8221;</p>

<p>The man held up his lantern so that the dim light shone
on his new recruit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>&#8220;Built for it, you be,&#8221; he said after a moment. &#8220;Long, and
lean, and tough, by the look of you. Are you tough, lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tougher&#8217;n a biled owl,&#8221; said Tom imperturbably.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you swim?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like a muskrat.&#8221;</p>

<p>The man grinned. &#8220;What&#8217;s your trade?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a timber man. Floating logs downstream out of the
Hampshire woods is my trade.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good! Come along then. Down by the water. Ike Baldwin
has charge o&#8217; the action, and he&#8217;s gathered his men
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom followed as he was bidden, down a rough path to the
border of Chelsea Creek. Looking over his shoulder once, he
saw in the sky a long streak of sunrise, salmon and silver-gray.</p>

<p>The Neck ended in a narrow strip of shaly beach, and as
Tom moved out of the protecting reeds he drew his head
down turtle-fashion. A British ball whined past him, and
then another. Half an hour now, and it would be broad daylight.
Whatever this seafaring operation was, they&#8217;d better
get it over, and soon. Then a little group of men loomed up
in the thinning mist ahead of him. Eight, nine, he counted,
most of them no older than he. They were stripped to the
waist and unarmed, save for their leader, a stalwart man in
a blue coat and knee breeches who leaned on a musket. Tom
and his guide approached the group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s your twelfth, Ike,&#8221; said the brown-coated man.
&#8220;Swims like a muskrat, tougher&#8217;n a biled owl, and is used to
riding log rafts down the Merrimack. Think he&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ike cleared his throat and spat into the water lapping
gently along the beach. &#8220;Have to, now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
sitting ducks in fifteen minutes more. Cal and &#8217;Lisha&#8217;s gone
for a keg of pitch.&#8221; He turned to Tom. &#8220;You one o&#8217; Stark&#8217;s
men?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>&#8220;Aye. Tom Trask of Derryfield.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Get rid of your gun and strip down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom looked around and found an outcrop of ledge where
he thought he could probably leave the blunderbuss in safety.
Then he peeled off his hunting shirt. British mortar fire still
droned overhead&mdash;too high; he had heard back in camp that
the British usually shot that way. As he shook his hands free
from the loose sleeves and flung the garment down, he lifted
his head and looked at the man nearest to him. Then a wry
smile twisted his mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I seen you before,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The other lad peered through the thinning mist, then his
eyes widened in recognition and he smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; he answered jauntily. &#8220;Last time I seen you, you
was playing hide-and-seek. You grown up yet, I wonder?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was others playing it, too,&#8221; retorted Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, others. Kitty Greenleaf, you&#8217;ll likely remember.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kitty Greenleaf! So that&#8217;s her name. I never did know
the whole of it. Promised her I&#8217;d call by and see her, if I ever
happened back that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t take the trouble. Kitty&#8217;s closer now. She&#8217;s in
Charlestown with her cousin, Sally Rose. I went home to
get some clean shirts and a better gun, and &#8217;twas there I heard
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Charlestown?&#8221; asked Tom in surprise. &#8220;Charlestown&#8217;s
not held to be very safe these days. &#8217;Tis thought the British
may strike at us from there. I heard there be only a couple
hundred people left in the town, and most of the women sent
away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard so, too. But Sally Rose took a notion to go home
and nothing would stop her, so Kitty went along. I ain&#8217;t got
over there yet to see them, but I mean to. I heard Granny
Greenleaf went legging after them, mad as time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>Tom laughed in spite of himself as he remembered the
thin old voice quavering excitedly, &#8220;Stop, thief, stop!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe I&#8217;ll just go along with you, when you do go,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;What&#8217;s your name now? Eben, was it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eben! No! You&#8217;re thinking of Eben Poore. He&#8217;s naught
but a foolish little lad. I be Johnny Pettengall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So,&#8221; said Tom. In the river ahead of him he could see
two low green islands getting plainer every minute as the
mist cleared away. &#8220;Well, Johnny, for old times&#8217; sake then,
tell me what&#8217;s afoot and what are we down here for?&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny&#8217;s face brightened and his voice grew eager, now
that he was intent again on the business in hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Likely, being a New Hampshire man, you come in with
Stark&#8217;s reserves last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I wasn&#8217;t detailed to go&mdash;nor to stay, either. Couldn&#8217;t
sleep, and long in the night sometime, I thought I&#8217;d just
wander this way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I been here all along. We was sent over to Noddle&#8217;s Island
yesterday to drive the cattle off. Farmers who pasture
there have been selling beef to the British. We&#8217;d cleared off
Noddle, burned the house of one man who resisted, and was
on our way back across Hog Island, when a sloop and a
schooner sailed close in. Fired on us, they did, and o&#8217; course
we answered back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217; course,&#8221; agreed Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Been firing ever since, except for the schooner&mdash;the
<i>Diana</i>, she is, one of our men said who recognized her. She&#8217;s
run aground and been abandoned. It&#8217;s her we&#8217;re going out to
burn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom looked where the other lad pointed. Sure enough,
there in the gray light, not very far from shore, rode a two-masted
schooner, listing badly to one side. Her foresail hung
in long streamers that stirred as the morning wind blew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
through them. Her colors had been shot away, and the lower
side of her deck was all awash with sea.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, boys!&#8221; Ike Baldwin straightened them to attention
with his command. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Cal and &#8217;Lisha with the
pitch. Now we can go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two young men, dark-haired and muscular, came panting
up with a heavy keg between them, swung in a cradle of stout
rope. Baldwin went on, speaking rapidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cal and &#8217;Lisha will tow the pitch out to the schooner.
Got that now?&#8221;</p>

<p>General murmurs of assent passed among the little group.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; murmured Johnny brightly, like a smart lad repeating
catechism.</p>

<p>Tom inclined his head and chewed nervously at a bit of
grass he had picked up somewhere. It had a rank salty taste.
He wished he knew exactly what he was supposed to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;The rest of you ain&#8217;t going along for the swim, remember,&#8221;
the relentless orders went on. &#8220;You&#8217;re there to help
get the pitch aboard and spread it around on whatever parts
of her is driest and most likely to burn. Don&#8217;t want her to go
back into British service again. Don&#8217;t want the British to think
they can come shooting amongst us any time they choose
without having to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood still for a moment, in a defiant attitude, waiting
for his words to take effect.</p>

<p>&#8220;How we going to kindle the pitch, Ike?&#8221; asked a voice at
the rear of the group. &#8220;Flints and tinderboxes&#8217;ll be wetter&#8217;n
a drowned cat &#8217;fore we get there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isaac Baldwin frowned. Then his face cleared and he
waved a nonchalant hand. &#8220;Likely there&#8217;ll be a cookfire in
the galley,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She ain&#8217;t been abandoned long. Likely
you&#8217;ll find a tinderbox there&mdash;or somewhere else aboard.
Her crew must ha&#8217; had some means to light a fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe,&#8221; said Tom. He stood thoughtfully for a moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
wondering how much time he would have before Ike
Baldwin ordered them into the water. It would take a few
minutes, the thing he wanted to do.</p>

<p>Luck was with him, for Baldwin bent over just then to
speak with Cal and &#8217;Lisha who were tightening the cradle
ropes about the keg. He looked up the hill in the direction he
had come, then back at the creek again. Out beyond the
stranded <i>Diana</i>, the guns of the sloop were still firing harmlessly
away. After a moment of indecision, he turned and ran
up the hill.</p>

<p>He found the man he had been talking to a short time
before, seated now on a tuft of marsh grass, his gun beside
him. He was just in the act of filling a pipe, as Tom had
gambled he would be. The New Hampshire man loped up
and accosted him.</p>

<p>&#8220;You with that pipe there!&#8221;</p>

<p>The man did not look up. His fingers moved leisurely
with flints and tinder. He lit the pipe, drew on it deeply, then
took it from his mouth and asked, &#8220;Was you speaking to
me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. General Putnam gave out the word there was to be
no smoking amongst the men. He sent me to collect every
pipe I found lighted. Like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom&#8217;s hand reached forth lightning quick and snatched
the pipe from its owner&#8217;s startled jaws. Then he sprinted off,
down the Neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey! Give me back my pipe!&#8221; yelled the man, scrambling
to his feet, his arms flailing the air. &#8220;Them orders
against pipes was night orders only. It&#8217;s safe enough, now
day&#8217;s come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell it to General Putnam,&#8221; called Tom over his shoulder.
He did not slow his pace until he reached the beach. Cal
and &#8217;Lisha had waded out waist-deep, floating the keg between
them. The others plunged in now, and began swimming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
toward the schooner. Their officer laid his musket
down and shed his clothes, obviously intending to follow
them, like a shepherd after his sheep.</p>

<p>Tom stood still, put the pipe in his mouth, and took a pull
on it. Great Jehovah, it tasted worse than sulphur and molasses
that the old women dosed you with in the spring. It
tasted worse than wormwood and bear&#8217;s grease, worse than
dragonroot tea. Ike Baldwin stepped into the water now, and
Tom followed at a little distance. By and by he felt the river
floor sloping away under his feet, but he managed to keep on
wading, though the others launched forth and swam. He held
his head high and his neck still, and kept puffing on the pipe.
The schooner was only a little way off, stranded in shallow
water, but it seemed to Tom as if he would never get there,
with the ill-smelling wooden bowl and its little treasure of
fire. Maybe they wouldn&#8217;t need it, he thought, but if they did
they would need it bad, and he meant to have it on hand.</p>

<p>Once a British ball struck close by, throwing up a shower
of spray that left him shaken and half blinded, but he kept
puffing away at the pipe and forged steadily ahead. Then
another ball struck even closer. The British were finding the
range, he thought. They must have realized what their opponents
meant to do.</p>

<p>When he reached the schooner, she was so sharply tilted
that he found it as easy to climb aboard her as it would have
been to swarm up a sloping beach. The other lads were there
ahead of him, busy spreading pitch on a pile of canvas mattresses
and hammocks fetched up from the sleeping quarters
below, spreading it on the dry parts of the deck above water
line.</p>

<p>A brisk wind sang through the <i>Diana&#8217;s</i> broken rigging. It
struck cold on Tom&#8217;s bare shoulders and drove the last of the
mist away. Sounds of firing came from the British sloop, but
he forgot the sloop. He cupped his hands about the pipe bowl<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
to shelter its living contents from the wind. He took a long
puff.</p>

<p>&#8220;So this is the way Stark trains his lads!&#8221; Isaac Baldwin&#8217;s
voice lashed out at him. He turned sharply and looked into
the grim, angry face of their leader.</p>

<p>Tom took the pipe cautiously from his mouth. &#8220;&#8217;T hasn&#8217;t
got nothing to do with Stark,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;If this were a regular engagement, you could be court-martialed.
Smoking a pipe! Skulking here smoking a pipe!
Look at the other lads!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom stared miserably at the busy group who were still
heaping up whatever inflammables they could find. Then he
put the pipe back in his mouth and gave another dogged puff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here! Give me that!&#8221; Livid with rage, Ike Baldwin
made a grab for the pipe.</p>

<p>Tom put one hand up before his face and ducked away.
The deck under his feet was worn by the tramp of many men,
and it was slippery with morning dew. He fell, half recovered
himself, and then went down on his knees, his teeth still
clamped to the pipestem.</p>

<p>From the hatchway that led below came confused cries.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Captain! Tell the Captain there&#8217;s not a spark aboard
her! Galley fire&#8217;s been put out and the ashes raked over! Not
a flint! Not a tinderbox! How&#8217;s to have a burning without
fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom felt his pulses quicken. It was as if there were shooting
sparks of triumph in his blood. His guess had been right,
then. He lifted his head. Baldwin had turned away, having
greater troubles now.</p>

<p>&#8220;There must be flints somewhere,&#8221; he exclaimed crustily.
&#8220;Have you searched the officers&#8217; quarters? The mess cabin?
The hold?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, sir. Everywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom got to his feet and looked around him. The men were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
standing idle now, about the heap of mattresses. They looked
bewildered and&mdash;well, not afraid&mdash;uneasy, maybe. Turning
his head a little, he saw the green shores of Hog Island with
Noddle&#8217;s Island just beyond it, and far beyond that, the roofs
of Boston touched with the morning sun. In the foreground
hovered the British sloop. Her guns were silent now, but her
sails were spread and she seemed to be drawing close. Perhaps
this was the time for him to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Give me that pipe!&#8221; Isaac Baldwin&#8217;s command had a different
tone to it this time. Before he had been angry and
somewhat scornful. Now his voice was full of eagerness,
quick and keen.</p>

<p>Tom took the pipe from his mouth. &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
thought we might need it, sir. That&#8217;s why I brought it along.
I&mdash;I&#8217;m not much of a smoking man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good boy,&#8221; said Isaac Baldwin.</p>

<p>He walked quickly across the deck, knelt down, and ripped
a bit of tow from a mattress, testing the dryness of it with his
fingers. Then he placed it lightly across the bowl of the pipe.</p>

<p>The other men were holding their breaths as they looked
on. Tom watched, too, but he felt a strange dizziness coming
over him, so he went and clung to the rail.</p>

<p>At first nothing happened. Then it was as if the tow began
to melt away. Ike held a larger piece of tow above the first
one&mdash;a fluffed-out piece. Suddenly the fluff burst into open
flame. Someone started to cheer and quickly choked the
sound back. From the fluff, Ike lighted a still larger piece of
tow and dropped that on the heap of bedding. The men
watched, fascinated. First one little tongue of flame leaped
up and then another. Then a tiny roaring sound began, growing
louder every moment.</p>

<p>When he saw that there was a splendid bonfire a-going,
Tom turned to the rail and hung weakly overside. He knew
now that his trick had worked and the British schooner would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
soon be a seething mass of flame. Soon his comrades, their
mission accomplished, would be leaping overside and swimming
back to Chelsea Neck. When that time came, he knew,
he would straighten himself up and go with them, but right
now there was a rancid taste in his mouth and the smell of
burning pitch in his nostrils. He&#8217;d had enough of pipe-smoking
to last him a lifetime, and he didn&#8217;t feel very well&mdash;in
fact, he didn&#8217;t feel well at all.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Nine</i><br />


<small>NO CLOUDS ON BUNKER HILL</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Never</span> expected to see you keeping a public house, Ma&#8217;am
Greenleaf&mdash;leastwise, not one with a strong drink
license.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Timothy Coffin&#8217;s voice had disapproval in it, Kitty
thought, as she turned from the small oak bar where she was
polishing glasses. The warm June sunshine struck through
the diamond-shaped panes and lay in pools of light with
rainbow edges on the sanded floor, on the worn tables and
benches. A gentle breeze stirred the tall hollyhock stems outside
the window. Sally Rose was weeding the hollyhocks&mdash;or
supposed to be. Now that Gran had come to take charge,
there was a task for everyone.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a-going to see a deal of things you never expected
to see,&#8221; said Gran tartly. She was seated by the hearth shelling
peas, while Timothy swept the tiles with a birch broom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Happen you&#8217;re right, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; agreed the old man.
&#8220;Never expected to see the King&#8217;s men shooting at us&mdash;and
we going to meeting, praying for the King, all the while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s a strange state of affairs, Timothy,&#8221; answered
Gran. Her voice had turned suddenly thoughtful, and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
fingers played idly with the empty pods as she stared through
the open door at the empty house across the way.</p>

<p>Kitty looked at the empty house, too. Most of the houses
in Charlestown were empty now, and scarcely any women
left in the town at all. The men came back sometimes to cut
hay and weed their gardens, but they had sent their families
away to the inland towns, and swore they would leave them
there till this fuss with the British soldiers was ended, one
way or another.</p>

<p>This was bad for business, of course. Here it was, nearly ten
o&#8217;clock of a fine hot Tuesday morning, sixth of June by the
almanac, and she hadn&#8217;t served a single customer.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be set up in terms of this &#8220;fuss,&#8221;
nowadays. For instance, she and Gran and Sally Rose living
here in Charlestown and running the Bay and Beagle, while
Uncle Job was away with the Massachusetts troops somewhere.
Not knowing they were here, thinking Sally Rose
was safe in Newburyport, he hadn&#8217;t come home. Then when
Gran came to join them, hopping mad at the trick Sally Rose
had played, she brought Dick Moody and Timothy along to
do the men&#8217;s work about the place. They hadn&#8217;t stayed in
camp long, for Dick was young and couldn&#8217;t shoot well
enough, and Timothy was old, and his bones creaked. But
all they wanted to talk about was the camp and the goings-on
there. But they didn&#8217;t call it a &#8220;fuss&#8221; like Gran did. They
called it a war. And that had a much more important and
terrible sound.</p>

<p>War was terrible, Kitty knew, so terrible that it couldn&#8217;t
be going to happen right here in front of her eyes, to people
she knew, maybe to herself&mdash;not really.</p>

<p>Dick came in from the backyard with an armful of wood
and stacked it carefully beside the hearth. Then he stood
silent and respectful, looking at Granny.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>Dick had grown taller, Kitty thought, and next time he
went to camp, as he threatened to do every day or so, it
wasn&#8217;t likely they&#8217;d send him home for being too young.
Sometimes he and Timothy went to the cow pasture at the
foot of Bunker Hill and practiced a little with Timothy&#8217;s gun&mdash;not
much, though, because they didn&#8217;t want to waste
powder and ball. Suddenly she realized Dick was speaking.
He looked at her, but he addressed himself to Granny.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you for bringing me down here, near where I
wanted to be. But I&#8217;m quitting your service now, Ma&#8217;am
Greenleaf.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, go get yourself a slice of bread and molasses, and
you&#8217;ll think better of it,&#8221; said Granny. &#8220;You can put maple
sugar on it, too,&#8221; she added.</p>

<p>Dick&#8217;s face grew red, and his young voice had an unfamiliar
harshness in it. &#8220;You&#8217;ve fed me well enough, Ma&#8217;am. It&#8217;s
not on account of the food and wages I&#8217;m leaving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it then, and what do you think to do?&#8221; asked
Gran, with an air of rapidly exhausting patience.</p>

<p>&#8220;Up the Mystic a ways&mdash;in one o&#8217; the swamps there&mdash;some
men from Gloucester are building fire boats. I been in
the ship-building trade. They said I could help them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire boats!&#8221; Granny tried to laugh, but there was no
merriment in the noise she made. It sounded like a cackle.
&#8220;And what do you think to do with fire boats, pray?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what do most folk do with fire? Burn something.
Maybe one o&#8217; the British schooners, or men-o&#8217;-war, even.
Maybe burn Boston, for all I know. Whatever our orders
say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t burn Boston,&#8221; retorted Granny severely. &#8220;Boston
don&#8217;t belong to the British soldiery. Houses and shops and
all belongs to Americans, as good as you be. True, they&#8217;ve
most of them fled from it now, but they&#8217;ll be back some day&mdash;when
this fuss is over, and God send that happen right soon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Now whatever is that drum a-beating for?&#8221; She held up her
head and listened. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard fife and drum music enough
to last me a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll hear more of it before you hear less, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221;
muttered Timothy.</p>

<p>Dick hurried to the door and stared up the road that led
to the Neck, from which the sound came. Kitty went to stand
beside him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you really going back to be with the Army, Dick?&#8221;
she asked, in one of the brief pauses between the slow beats of
the drum.</p>

<p>Dick cleared his throat. &#8220;Seems like I have to,&#8221; he murmured.
&#8220;Would it matter to you, Kit, if I&mdash;&#8221; His voice broke
off, and his hand just brushed her shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Kitty! Kitty!&#8221; cried Sally Rose as she came flying
down the street, her bright hair loose on her shoulders and
her cheeks flushed with excitement. &#8220;They&#8217;re bringing the
prisoners! There&#8217;s going to be an exchange! Perhaps Gerry
will be in it!&#8221;</p>

<p>She dropped down on the broad doorstone and sat there,
trying to get back her breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; asked Dick quickly. He was not
looking at Sally Rose, but up the winding street that led to
Charlestown Neck and the towns beyond it on the mainland.</p>

<p>Kitty looked, too. Down the narrow way between the
gabled houses came a slowly moving procession. First the
drummer stepped out, a scrawny lad not much taller than
Dick. He walked all alone, beating a brass-bound drum, and
behind him followed a black horse drawing a phaeton with
two men in it. After the phaeton rode two British officers on
horseback. She could see nothing more at the moment because
of a crook in the street. A little crowd was beginning to
gather in the direction of Market Square. Sally Rose finally
got back her breath and answered Dick&#8217;s question.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>&#8220;When I heard the drum I ran down to Mr. Bassett&#8217;s
wine shop. He&#8217;s back in town, you know, to cut his hay on the
Point Road, and I asked him what was happening. He said
he heard&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The drummer had come even with the Bay and Beagle
now, and his steady beating drowned out the girl&#8217;s excited
voice. Sally Rose stopped talking and got to her feet. She and
Dick and Kitty stood together in the tavern doorway and
watched the slow procession advance and pass close by them.</p>

<p>The two men who rode in the phaeton behind the drummer
were in odd contrast to each other, and yet there was the
same air of dignity and purpose enveloping both of them.
One was old&mdash;not so old as Timothy, but not young any
more. He was broad-shouldered and sturdy and had a round,
good-natured face and a shock of tousled gray hair. He wore
a blue uniform. His companion was younger, fair-haired and
blue-eyed, with a ruddy face and a fresh, scrubbed look
about him. He was not a soldier, apparently, for his coat was
fawn-colored with a white-fringed waistcoat underneath.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Old Put,&#8221; said Timothy proudly, for he and Gran
had come to stand just behind them. &#8220;See! In the blue coat
there! General Putnam. His wife must ha&#8217; sent him his uniform.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why would she have to do that?&#8221; asked Gran tartly.
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t go off to war without it, would he?&#8221;</p>

<p>Timothy chuckled. &#8220;That&#8217;s just what he done! When he
heard about Concord Fight, he was building a stone wall on
his farm away down in Connecticut. But he come just as he
was, in leather breeches and apron. Got here at next day&#8217;s
sunrise, they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess there was others got here just as quick as he did,&#8221;
answered Gran. &#8220;Yourself for one.&#8221; She peered over Kitty&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8220;Who be that by his side?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Dr. Warren. Best damn man, I say, that ever come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
out o&#8217; Boston. Don&#8217;t know how General Ward would run
Cambridge Camp without him. Figures out how to get supplies,
and men, and money, and all. He&#8217;s got book learning
and can talk to anybody. More&#8217;n that, he&#8217;s a good doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are the prisoners, I wonder?&#8221; asked Sally Rose.</p>

<p>Kitty nudged her, and she subsided.</p>

<p>After the phaeton came two British officers, splendid in
white and scarlet, and riding sleek horses; then another officer
in a chaise; then a handful of officers on foot. They were
escorted by a blue-uniformed guard that Timothy said
looked to him like Connecticut men. By now the drummer
had turned into Ferry Street, heading for the wharves at the
waterside. Here and there stood a little cluster of men, here
and there a woman&#8217;s head appeared at a gable window, but
the spectators were few. At the very end of the procession a
farm cart rattled along, drawn by two plow horses. A group
of men sprawled on the floor of it, men in tattered British
uniforms, pale and unshaven, unable to walk, apparently,
because of wounds or illness. They looked so forlorn and
miserable that Kitty felt tears start to her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh,&#8221; she whispered to Sally Rose, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for the
poor lads. I don&#8217;t care if they are British.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t come out shooting at us, they wouldn&#8217;t be
in this pickle now,&#8221; growled Timothy. &#8220;Wonder where is
our boys we&#8217;re supposed to get back in the exchange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Bassett says they&#8217;re aboard the <i>Lively</i>,&#8221; said Sally
Rose. &#8220;Oh&mdash;oh&mdash;Kitty&mdash;&#8221; She clapped her hand over her
mouth.</p>

<p>For a moment Kitty did not see anything to exclaim about.
The cart full of prisoners trundled slowly by. Close beside it
walked a young man in a rough woolen shirt and homespun
breeches. He carried a knapsack, and a large wooden bottle
was slung from his shoulder by a leather strap. Just then the
procession halted a moment. Up ahead, the drummer turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
down Ferry Street on his way to the docks to meet the boats
from the <i>Lively</i>. The phaeton bent its wheels sharply to
round the corner. In the pause the young man unstoppered
the wooden bottle and held it over the side of the cart so one
of the prisoners could drink. The rear guard, another group
of blue-coated Connecticut men, halted too. They were apparently
the last of the procession.</p>

<p>Kitty glanced again at her cousin. Sally Rose stood up
proud and smiling. The long lashes about her hazel eyes
flickered provocatively. Sally Rose was watching the young
man with the bottle. For that reason, and that reason alone,
Kitty looked closer at him herself.</p>

<p>He turned just then and smiled at them. He had dark hair,
she saw, and deep-set blue eyes. My, he was certainly handsome!
Living all her life in Newburyport, she hadn&#8217;t realized
how many handsome men there were in the world&mdash;drifting
down the Merrimack on a log raft, walking the road
that ran past Bunker Hill. They were everywhere, now that
she had suddenly grown up enough to look at them. Sally
Rose had always known. Sally Rose was born grown up.</p>

<p>She cast a sudden look at Dick, and knew instinctively that
she would never kiss him good night again, or if she did, it
would be with a difference. Their kissing days were over.
Dick was an old friend now, and only that. Never again
would he stir in her that strange tremulous feeling that went
with a new moon and apple blossoms and the first warm
nights of spring. She knew, but she did not know how it was
that she knew.</p>

<p>The young man in the leather breeches was still smiling.
He lifted his hand, oh so slightly, and motioned toward the
docks. Then the cart wheels began to turn again, and the
procession plodded on. The little group around the door of
the Bay and Beagle watched until the last straggler was out
of sight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s over,&#8221; said Gran briskly, &#8220;It&#8217;s well past
noon, and I expect we&#8217;ll have custom. If you&#8217;re leaving us,
Master Dick, you might as well be off, and good luck to you&mdash;the
same as I&#8217;d wish to the son of any neighbor. Timothy,
you better bring up another keg of brandy from the cellar.
You can tend the taps for awhile, Kitty, and Sally Rose&mdash;why,
where is Sally Rose?&#8221;</p>

<p>They called and called and searched the bedrooms and the
attic and the back garden, but the girl was nowhere to be
found. Dick left, after a bit, taking his spare shirt with him, a
small ham, and a hunting knife proffered by Timothy. The
old man went on his errand to the cellar, and Kitty returned
to polishing glasses. A few men drifted in to drink beer and
cider and talk about the exchange of prisoners. Gran muttered
a few dark words about the flightiness of the younger generation
and went into the kitchen to put the bread to rise and
make pease porridge for supper. Bread and beer and pease
porridge folk had to have, thought Kitty, no matter if wars
came about, and handsome young men went out to be killed
in them, and girls grew up all too late.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Trade got brisker during the long hot afternoon, and Kitty
was kept busy filling mugs and glasses. She learned from the
talk of the men who happened in that the British prisoners
had been sent out by boat to the great, threatening man-o&#8217;-war
that swung at anchor in the channel, halfway to Boston.
The officers in charge of the business had all come into town
to take some refreshment and expected shortly to return to
the dock to receive the American lads whose delivery would
complete the exchange. Everything had been conducted in
an orderly and courteous fashion.</p>

<p>Gradually the excitement died down. Gran put on her
second best straw bonnet and went out to look for Sally Rose.
Timothy had trouble getting the brandy keg up the cellar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
stairs. Bees droned loudly in the hollyhocks, and gulls cried
from the harbor. Slowly the sun moved over to the westward
side of the roofs and gables. It was a summer afternoon like
any other summer afternoon.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, Sally Rose was back. She slipped
in quietly, like a shadow. On her face was that cat-stealing-cream
look that fitted her so well. She went straight to the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Kitty hastily served a waiting customer, that same Mr.
Bassett who had come back to Charlestown to cut his hay, and
then she followed her cousin. Sally Rose stood by the water
bucket, the dipper lifted to her mouth. She drank thirstily.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, that tastes good,&#8221; she said, licking her wet red lips.
&#8220;It was hot down by the dockside. Not a sea breeze anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been to the docks?&#8221; asked Kitty curiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course. Didn&#8217;t you see Gerry wave to me to follow
him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gerry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, Kit!&#8221; Sally Rose&#8217;s voice had a ring of impatience
in it. &#8220;I tried to make signs to you. I thought by the
look of your face you understood me. You were surely
staring at him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Staring at whom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh Kitty! You saw him! Gerry was the lad in the homespun
breeches who marched beside the prisoners&#8217; cart. He was
the only one able to walk, and so he had to wait on them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but that lad&mdash;he looked like an American. His
clothes&mdash;I thought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course! Gerry was pretending to be an American when
we captured him. That&#8217;s why he was looking so shabby. You
should see him in his captain&#8217;s uniform! He&#8217;s been kept in a
tent in Cambridge&mdash;a tent made of old sailcloth that the rain
came through, and guards all around him. But he was exchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
this afternoon. I went down to the dock and talked
to him while the boats were putting off. He&#8217;s gone safe to
his own regiment in Boston now. But he says he&#8217;ll come back
to see me&mdash;another day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nice,&#8221; said Kitty. &#8220;That&#8217;s very nice indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>She felt cross suddenly. It must be the heat, or because
she had been working so hard, or because she had forgotten
to eat any dinner. It might be the outrageous behavior of
Sally Rose. There are many ways to explain such a thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you know he said ...&#8221; Sally Rose rattled on.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a hoarse cry from the cellar stairs&mdash;a
burst of strong language, then a deep groan of pain. The
girls looked at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s Timothy!&#8221; gasped Kit. &#8220;He was trying to bring
up a brandy keg. He must have fallen.&#8221;</p>

<p>The groans continued. She ran to the head of the cellar
stairs and looked down. Sure enough, the old man lay on the
dank earth that served for a flooring, the heavy keg on top
of his right foot, his left leg bent beneath him.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re coming, Timothy,&#8221; she called. &#8220;We&#8217;ll help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gazed desperately around the taproom, but it was
empty. The last customer had gone. Again she and Sally
Rose stood looking at each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll need a doctor,&#8221; murmured Kitty. &#8220;He&#8217;s sure to
need a doctor. Whether there&#8217;s one left in town or not, I
don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly her cousin&#8217;s face lighted. &#8220;Of course there&#8217;s one
in town,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Timothy himself pointed one out. That
kind-looking man who rode in the phaeton with Old Put.
Dr. Warren of Boston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;of course I remember. But he&#8217;ll be dining with the
British officers. He&#8217;s an important official, I think, like a
minister or a judge. He was wearing a fine coat, Sally Rose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
He won&#8217;t want to leave his wine and go down in a dirty cellar
to tend a poor old man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t tell,&#8221; said Sally Rose. &#8220;You can&#8217;t tell at all. He
looked kind. I&#8217;m going to try to find him.&#8221; She ran through
the doorway.</p>

<p>Kitty stepped gingerly down the cellar stairs to see if she
could help the old man. He could only moan and grunt and
utter inarticulate sounds when she tried to talk to him, but
she managed to roll the heavy cask off his foot and drag him
into a sitting position against the roots of the massive chimney.
It seemed hours before she heard footsteps on the floor
overhead, but later she realized it could not have been very
long.</p>

<p>A moment later the fair-haired doctor in his neat coat and
breeches stepped nimbly down the stairway. Four of the
blue-coated Connecticut lads swarmed after.</p>

<p>Dr. Warren looked around him in the dim light, at the
cobwebbed depths of the cellar: at the empty vegetable bins
waiting for this year&#8217;s harvest, the shelves of preserves and
jellies in stone crocks, the casks that held the stock in trade
of the tavern above. He smiled briefly at Kitty, then he went
down on his knees on the earth floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;A bad mishap, Timothy,&#8221; he said, bending over the old
man. There was a note of cheery courage in his voice. Kitty
felt it, and she knew that Timothy felt it too. The old man
spoke weakly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, sir. All the brandy in the house be not in that blasted
keg there. Have the lass to fetch me a swig, if you will, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty did not need to be told again. She ran upstairs to
fetch a glass of brandy. When she came back, the doctor had
cut Timothy&#8217;s boot away and bared the flesh beneath it. He
shook his head, and there was a sober look on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Tis somewhat crushed I fear. Drink up your brandy,
sir, and I will patch it as best I can. Then the lads will carry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
you upstairs&mdash;where there should be a bed waiting.&#8221; He
looked questioningly at Kitty.</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be,&#8221; she assured him tremulously. &#8220;I spoke to
my cousin, Sally Rose. She&#8217;s getting it ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held the brandy glass to Timothy&#8217;s mouth, and the
old man sipped feebly. Sometimes he flinched, as the doctor
worked at the broken foot, reshaping it, applying splints and
bandages. He did not utter a word, but his breath came in
painful gasps, and he was shivering. The young soldiers
stood looking on.</p>

<p>Dr. Warren talked as he worked, hoping, perhaps, to distract
the old man&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;to tell you the truth, sir, I was glad
enough when the young lady came to fetch me here. I was in
the act of quarreling with Old Put as we partook of a roast
goose and glasses of claret. Somehow, in spite of the present
triumph of more cautious gentlemen, I fear the General may
yet have his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Timothy grinned faintly. &#8220;I be sorry for ye,&#8221; he whispered,
&#8220;if ye quarreled with Old Put.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and I felt I was getting the worst of it, though it
seems that at the moment all the greatest powers in our
Great American Army be on my side. Steady, Timothy! This
will take but a minute. There! As I was saying, the whole
camp has been in an uproar the past month, as to whether or
not we should fortify Bunker Hill and make a stand against
the British there. Some say we must fight them, and it better
be soon rather than late. Old Put and Prescott go with that
way of thinking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fortify Bunker Hill?&#8221; whispered Timothy manfully
through his pain. &#8220;Why, that be close by!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very close,&#8221; said the doctor. &#8220;General Ward and I have
talked much about it. I have been housed at his Cambridge
headquarters of late, where I can easily visit the Provincial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
Congress in Watertown. He and I think our men are not
yet ready to make a stand. We are against such an incautious
display of valor. Later, perhaps, but not until we have a
better equipped and conditioned army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wisht,&#8221; muttered Timothy, &#8220;I had displayed less incautious
valor with that brandy keg. In God&#8217;s mercy, I do,
sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dr. Warren tightened the last bandage and got to his feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Take him up carefully, lads,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and carry him
above stairs. The little golden-head will show you where.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty thought fleetingly that even the great doctor had
been enough like common men so that he had an eye for the
beauty of Sally Rose. She had hardly noticed what he said
about a battle on Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>But she thought about it later when she was standing at
the tavern door in the hot dusk, looking past the roofs of
Charlestown at the green countryside rising behind it. Gran
was at home now, alternately tending Timothy and scolding
Sally Rose. The doctor and the soldiers had long since gone,
and the exchange of prisoners was probably complete.</p>

<p>Bunker Hill rose smooth and round and green. Breed&#8217;s
Hill, not so tall, was nearer the point, and the third hill,
away to the southeast, she could not see. The hills were criss-crossed
with rail fences and stone walls, divided into orchards,
gardens, and pasture land. Daisies and buttercups
bloomed all white and gold in the hayfields. The locust trees
rose tall, and the elm trees taller. Hard green fruit clung to
the apple boughs, and tassels were coming on the stalks of
Indian corn. Gulls cried from the harbor, and a bat swooped
down from the eaves above her head, and darted off, winging
its way from side to side of the crooked street.</p>

<p>Away to the eastward a low-lying cloud bank merged with
the dim sea. There were clouds in the west, too, and thickening
round the hills and steeples of Boston. But over Bunker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
Hill the sky was clear, lighted with one pale star. She took it
to be a good omen&mdash;that there would be no battle there.</p>

<p>It seemed to Kitty the most peaceful landscape she had
ever seen in her life. And yet, the talk was, &#8220;Fortify Bunker
Hill! Make a stand against the British there!&#8221; She was glad
Dr. Warren did not favor it, and she hoped he would have
his way. She thought maybe she would have liked the young
man by the prisoners&#8217; cart, if she had ever come to know him.
But then, she had never dreamed that he was not an American.
And he had turned out to be her cousin&#8217;s British Gerry.
He probably wouldn&#8217;t have looked so handsome to her if he
had been wearing his red coat.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Ten</i><br />


<small>A TRYST WITH THE ENEMY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;But</span> what makes you so sure he will be there, Sally
Rose,&#8221; asked Kitty, &#8220;if you haven&#8217;t had any word?&#8221;</p>

<p>She was curled up in the middle of the four-poster bed
which she shared with her cousin. Sally Rose sat at the dressing
table. A candle burned at each side of the mirror, and she
was studying her reflection in its glass. She wore nothing but
a thin cambric shift, and her feet were bare.</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me he would come in a week&#8217;s time, if not before.
He promised it wouldn&#8217;t be more than that. When he got
aboard the boat to go to the <i>Lively</i>, he promised me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty stared past Sally Rose&#8217;s golden head into the dark
street. Their bedroom was over the kitchen, and she could
hear Gran&#8217;s brisk footsteps trotting about below. Gran was
roasting mutton to feed tomorrow&#8217;s customers, but she had
sent the girls upstairs to get their beauty sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve slipped out to our old meeting place in the graveyard
every night, but he was never there,&#8221; she went on. &#8220;But tonight
it&#8217;s Tuesday again, so he has to be. He just has to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
there tonight.&#8221; She pulled on a pair of delicate thread stockings,
and thrust her feet into high-heeled slippers with roses
on the toes.</p>

<p>Kitty eyed them disapprovingly. &#8220;As I remember the old
graveyard, it&#8217;s full of holes and hummocks,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll trip and fall in those shoes, if you go walking there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect to do much walking,&#8221; said Sally Rose.</p>

<p>Then a mischievous light shone out of her hazel eyes.
&#8220;Kitty! Wait till you see what I bought today. The shops are
full of bargains, with all the Tories gone out of town. You&#8217;ll
have to help me, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>She scurried to the clothespress, reached inside it, and
brought out the most hideous contraption Kitty had ever
seen. It was a pair of stays, she supposed, but what a pair! A
long cruel case of whalebone and stiff buckram, high in the
back, very low in the front, pinched and pointed like the body
of some vicious insect. That it was covered with white velvet
and sewn with brilliants did not make it any the less frightening.
Kitty got a cramp in her stomach as she looked at it. Her
chest tightened, and for a moment she had trouble in breathing.
But Sally Rose had a gleam in her eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got this at the staymaker&#8217;s this morning,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He
ordered it for a rich Tory lady, but she fled away to join the
British in Boston, so he let me have it cheap.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think he might,&#8221; said Kitty. &#8220;Why it&#8217;s hardly a
foot around the middle. You&#8217;re slender, but not that slender,
Sally Rose. How do you think to lace it up?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose smiled engagingly and stepped into the dreadful
garment, dragging it over her hips and around her slight
form. &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll have to lace it for me, Kit,&#8221; she announced.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a truly fashionable figure now. I always wanted
one. Remember, Gerry&#8217;s been looking at those rich Boston
ladies all the week long. I don&#8217;t want him to feel disappointed
when he sees me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>Kitty climbed down from the bed and went to her cousin.
She picked up the ends of the lacings and began to weave
them into the metal hooks. Sally Rose stood there beaming,
holding the stays in place.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry and lace them up, Kit,&#8221; she urged. &#8220;It will be
easier if I can slip out while Gran is still at her work. Before
she comes upstairs, I mean to be gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>With a great effort Kitty drew the stays together at the
bottom, clamping her cousin&#8217;s slim hips and belly into a
frighteningly narrow space. The garment had been designed
for a much taller girl, and came well down over the thigh,
almost to the knee. It fastened at the bottom with a tiny
jeweled padlock, and Kitty noted a similar one at the top.
She hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does this unlock with a key?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Sally Rose held up a tiny bit of gold on a satin ribbon.
&#8220;Oh, it does, Kitty, and I have the key here. Isn&#8217;t it all deliciously
clever?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; muttered Kitty. &#8220;Hold your stomach in.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose compressed herself to the utmost and closed
her eyes. Kitty fastened the padlock and struggled with the
lacings.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tighter! Tighter!&#8221; gasped Sally Rose.</p>

<p>Kitty pulled at the strong cord until it almost cut her
fingers. It was waxed, and it had a toughness about it that
made her think of wire.</p>

<p>After a moment she shoved Sally Rose up against the wall,
sat down in a chair in front of her, braced her knees, and
laboriously threaded and pulled till the task was over and
she could snap the jeweled padlock at the top. Then she
stood off to view her work.</p>

<p>Sally Rose looked like a long white worm standing up on
its tail&mdash;or like a white candle, if you wanted to be poetic&mdash;but
more like a worm. Her face was flushed, and she could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
take only the shortest, shallowest breaths, but there was
triumph in her eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now my dress and petticoat, Kitty, if you&#8217;ll be so good.
Oh wait till Gerry sees me! He&#8217;ll be so o&#8217;ercome with admiration
he&#8217;ll scarce know what to say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be o&#8217;ercome, I don&#8217;t doubt,&#8221; said Kitty. &#8220;Especially
if he tries to put his arm around you. You feel like a stick of
cord wood.&#8221; She fastened the gauze petticoat over the stays
and then brought the sky-blue muslin gown Sally Rose had
laid out on a chair.</p>

<p>Was life going to be like this always, she wondered somewhat
wistfully; helping Sally Rose to dress, letting Sally
Rose in when the evening was over; herself never dressing
up, never meeting anyone, never going anywhere? She
wished that Tom Trask the logger had the daring British
Gerry had. Gossip said that the New Hampshire men were
in camp in Medford, and Medford wasn&#8217;t much farther than
Boston. But he had no way of knowing she was so near him,
of course. Perhaps when things got quieter after Concord
Fight, he&#8217;d gone back to Newburyport to return her father&#8217;s
gun. But now it seemed that battles were threatening again.
Perhaps&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now my gold gauze kerchief and my scent bottle,&#8221;
panted Sally Rose.</p>

<p>Kitty brought them. &#8220;Are you ready now?&#8221; she asked, trying
to keep the envy from her tone. It wasn&#8217;t Sally Rose&#8217;s
fault that she felt lonely and neglected, not Sally Rose&#8217;s
fault at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; sighed Sally Rose. &#8220;I&#8217;ll go down the
back stairs, I think, and through the garden. Good-by,
dear.&#8221; She held up her soft cheek.</p>

<p>Kitty brushed her lips against it. &#8220;Good-by, Sally Rose,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get into any trouble, and come home soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose laughed a little uneasily and made an awkward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
motion to step forward. But she did not step forward. She
stopped suddenly, twisted her body, or tried to, and put her
hand to her side.</p>

<p>&#8220;My, a bone jabbed me,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>After a moment she tried again to move forward. This
time she succeeded in taking three little hobbled steps. Then
she swayed clumsily, tripped, and fell on the rag rug. There
she lay like an overset turtle, unable to rise.</p>

<p>Kitty stuffed her handkerchief into her mouth to choke
back her laughter. Then she ran forward and struggled to
hoist Sally Rose to her feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I don&#8217;t think I can walk in this thing,&#8221; gasped Sally
Rose. &#8220;It&#8217;s like having two feet in one breeches leg. And the
bones hurt me. And it&#8217;s getting late. Take it off, Kit. Take it
off at once. Here&#8217;s the key.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still trying to keep back her laughter at the other girl&#8217;s
ridiculous plight, Kitty pulled off the blue dress and the
petticoat and fitted the tiny key into the jeweled lock. It refused
to turn, and she twisted it gently.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be in a pickle,&#8221; she muttered, &#8220;if it should break.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare break it!&#8221; squealed Sally Rose.</p>

<p>Kitty worked the key this way and that. Below in the
tavern kitchen Gran&#8217;s voice lifted up the words of an old
hymn. Through the open window drifted the scent of garden
flowers in the warm dark. Her hands got sticky with sweat.
She kept dropping the wretched little key.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry!&#8221; pleaded Sally Rose. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll come and
not find me. I&#8217;m afraid he&#8217;ll go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Desperately Kitty twisted the bit of metal.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Sally Rose,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;I can&#8217;t make
it work. What will we do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Cut the lacings, I suppose,&#8221; sighed Sally Rose, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll
try to wiggle out through the gap in the middle. I don&#8217;t care
much. I never should have bought it. Maybe the staymaker<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
will take it back. Get my shears. They&#8217;re in the workbox in
the top drawer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you left your workbox in the kitchen,&#8221; said Kit. &#8220;I
saw it there when we were scouring the pots after supper. All
the other shears and knives are there too, and if I went down,
I&#8217;d have to explain to Gran.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two girls looked at each other in dismay. Sally Rose
bit her lip. &#8220;Yes, you would,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And whatever excuse
you made, she might come back upstairs with you, and then
I&#8217;d never get away. Can&#8217;t you break the lacings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it,&#8221; said Kitty. &#8220;It&#8217;s the toughest cord I ever
saw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Try.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Kitty yanked and tugged and twisted, but the cord refused
to break. Sally Rose was hopelessly trapped.</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment. Then she clenched her
soft hands and stiffened her mouth. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to go just as I
am,&#8221; she said, and tried to walk again. Again she fell.</p>

<p>Kitty helped her up and led her to a chair. &#8220;Sit down, Sally
Rose,&#8221; she said gently. But Sally Rose could not sit down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s no use,&#8221; she murmured, reluctant, almost
tearful. &#8220;You&#8217;ll just have to go and tell Gerry I&#8217;m sick, or
something. Tell him to come back tomorrow night. I&#8217;ll surely
be there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty hesitated. She didn&#8217;t know quite why. Was it because
Gerry was British and she disapproved of the British? Or was
it a deeper, stranger thing&mdash;a sort of foreboding? A fear, and
yet an eagerness, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure you want me to, Sally Rose?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>Sally Rose stamped her foot, or tried to, then writhed as
a whalebone jabbed her. &#8220;Of course I do,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Go
quickly, do, and come back and tell me what he has to say.
Then we&#8217;ll have to get the shears and cut me out of this thing.
Oh Kitty, go now!&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>And so it was that Kitty Greenleaf slipped away to
Charlestown&#8217;s old graveyard that night to meet her country&#8217;s
enemy, her cousin&#8217;s exciting young man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An eerie little wind was blowing through the town that
night, a warm wind, and it had the tang of sea salt in it, and
the heavy sweetness of the new mown hay on Bunker Hill.
It ruffled Kitty&#8217;s hair and cooled her hot face as she walked
through the empty streets, past the Two Cranes, the courthouse,
and the meeting house with its tall white spire rising
against the dark. Few of the windows were lighted, but down
by the docks she could hear the familiar cry of the watch, and
over the bay the lights of Boston shone out bright and clear.
It was hard for her to remember that Boston was no longer a
friendly town.</p>

<p>When she reached the graveyard she felt her way along
the low wall that protected it from the street. Shadow lay
thick about the grassy mounds inside, and crooked elm
boughs meeting overhead shut out the thin glow of the starlight.
There was no moon.</p>

<p>Leaving the wall she blundered forward, now and then
brushing against one of the old headstones. She knew what
they looked like well enough: short thick slabs of greenish
slate with a death&#8217;s head at the top; some of reddish sandstone;
beyond them the granite tombs where the great families
lay. But she could not seem to find the path that would
lead her through. And then, somehow she did find it, and
groped her way to the wall on the far side with the open
fields beyond. He was standing there, just as she knew he
would be.</p>

<p>He carried a dark lantern, half open now to let a little
light shine through, and he wore the rough shirt and breeches
of an American farmer. Sally Rose would have been disappointed
had she hoped to see the scarlet coat. As he heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
her footstep on the worn grass he drew in his breath sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Sally Rose!&#8221; he whispered, and turned the lantern
full upon her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m sorry,&#8221; she stammered. &#8220;I&#8217;m her cousin Kitty.
She sent me to tell you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>And then suddenly, to her own horror, in spite of the awe
she felt for this handsome young stranger from the enemy
camp, in spite of the need to keep this tryst in silence and
secrecy, she began to giggle. She couldn&#8217;t help it when she
thought of Sally Rose trapped in the stays; of her pretty,
angry face on top of the body of a pinched white worm. She
put both hands to her mouth and rocked and rocked with
stifled mirth.</p>

<p>Then she realized that he was shaking her. &#8220;Stop it, Kitty,
if that&#8217;s your name,&#8221; he said. His voice was firm but not unkind.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s Sally Rose? Tell me what you are laughing
at? I want to laugh, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>He had put the lantern down and was holding her by both
shoulders. She could not see his face, and yet she knew what
he looked like. She would always remember him, she
thought, from that day when he marched past the Bay and
Beagle and she was standing at the door. Suddenly she found
herself telling him all about the stays and Sally Rose.</p>

<p>He kept very quiet until she had finished, but then he did
not laugh as she had expected him to do. When he spoke
again, his voice had an impatient sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve often heard the men in barracks say&mdash;the married
men, that is&mdash;that women have no sense at all. And I guess
they be right. I&#8217;m sorry Sally Rose did such a foolish thing.
I&mdash;I wanted&mdash;tonight it really mattered that I should see
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she will be here tomorrow night, sir,&#8221; answered
Kitty, not quite sure how one addressed a British officer who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
pretended not to be a British officer. &#8220;It will be such a little
time till then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A little time,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;but much may happen in it.
I may be here tomorrow night&mdash;but I trust she will not be.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; faltered Kitty.</p>

<p>A bough rustled a few yards off, and he flashed his lantern
that way and listened. After a moment he spoke again in a
lower tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;How does it happen you womenfolk are still in Charlestown?
I understood that it had been evacuated.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it has been&mdash;nearly. But Granny says she will not
abandon my uncle&#8217;s property here until she must. She says
she will stay and try to keep it intact for him, if she can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been known since April that we might burn the town
any day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know. But time goes on, and you do not do it, and we
grow less afraid. And all the while our Army is growing
larger and more strong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So is ours,&#8221; he retorted. &#8220;Three new generals arrived
from England; martial law proclaimed in Boston yesterday.
General Gage denounced you for rebels and traitors. If you
don&#8217;t disband and go your ways in peace soon, we&#8217;re coming
out to make you go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I suppose there will be a battle,&#8221; sighed Kitty. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
never know why it is men can&#8217;t settle a squabble without trying
to kill each other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again he flashed the lantern on her face and held it there
a moment. Then he spoke to her from out of the dark, and
his voice had a different sound.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know&mdash;Kitty&mdash;I don&#8217;t think I understand it either.
I never really wanted to be a soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A captain,&#8221; she corrected him. &#8220;A captain in the Twenty-third.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah yes, a captain. I can hear the watch coming down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
street, and we cannot leave here until he is gone. Sit down
on the grass.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed it was the watch, and she could hear him shouting
as he turned the corner by the brick well. &#8220;Ten o&#8217; the clock,
this thirteenth night o&#8217; June, and the weather fair. Town&#8217;s
empty, Sons o&#8217; Liberty gone to camp, Rogues and Tories to
Boston!&#8221;</p>

<p>The young Englishman drew her down in the shadow of a
flowering quince tree. She sat there straight and proper and
he sprawled with careless grace beside her, not alarmingly
near.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I never meant to bear arms, and how I came to do it
is no matter, but I, too, wish England and America could
settle their differences without spilling blood. Do you think
I am a coward, Kitty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said slowly. &#8220;I do not think that.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice of the watch grew louder. He must be passing
very close by.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have cursed the Americans, and yet I am not sure I was
right when I did it. I have gone amongst them some, even
been kept in gaol by them, and yet I can&#8217;t see that they&#8217;re
any worse fellows than I. I cannot help thinking that I myself
might have been an American. Except for a choice a man
made some hundred and fifty years ago. The right choice, of
course&mdash;and yet&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty felt her blood stir in a different way now. She had
been thrilling to his strangeness and his handsomeness, and
the excitement of this secret meeting. But now she had the
uncanny feel that there were ghosts about. Mighty ghosts,
ghosts of countries coming together, here in the dim starlight
in the shadow of Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;You an American? How?&#8221;</p>

<p>He settled comfortably in the grass. &#8220;Listen, Kitty, I&#8217;ll
tell you more of myself than I ever told Sally Rose. I do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
know why, unless it is because you are less distractingly fair.
Alas, I am afraid I like overwell to talk, Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So does everyone, it seems,&#8221; murmured Kitty. &#8220;But what
happened&mdash;a hundred and fifty years ago?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to talk, I suppose, because my mother was a strolling
player, and famous for the way she spoke her lines as
well as her good looks. She traveled the fairs and market
towns, and everywhere she was made welcome and a stage
set up for her. My father was a West Country farmer, and a
dull husband I think he made her. I cannot recall her too
well. But it was through his blood that I might have been
born an American.&#8221;</p>

<p>The voice of the watch was fading now, down by the tannery
and the distilleries, but Gerry Malory kept on talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;My father would shake his head, I remember, whenever
anyone mentioned America. &#8217;Twas a legend in our family
that once an old grandsire of ours, about the time I mention,
had journeyed to Plymouth and watched a shipful of people
leaving that country to settle in this one. That he thought for
a time to go with them, but decided against it. Sometimes I
wonder if he had gone&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The watch was coming back. They saw the light he carried.
It wavered to and fro. Then it stopped just at the wall of the
graveyard. Gerry Malory sprang hastily to his feet. &#8220;Kitty,&#8221;
he whispered, &#8220;go back and tell Sally Rose&mdash;I don&#8217;t know
when I&#8217;ll see her&mdash;but tell her to get out of Charlestown.
We&#8217;re getting ready to move against the Americans. I don&#8217;t
know when. At least by the end of the week. Some say we&#8217;re
for Dorchester Heights, and some say Bunker Hill. Tell her
to be gone. And you go with her&mdash;Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He vaulted over the low wall and disappeared in the darkness
between the fields and the flats along the river. Kitty
peered after him, but she saw only a scatter of fireflies and
a light mist rising from the earth. She was not afraid of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
watch, but he did not challenge her as she crept back to the
Bay and Beagle. He did not know she had been keeping a
tryst with the enemy. Well, she had been, and felt herself
none the worse for it.</p>

<p>She, too, was wondering what would have happened if old
Grandsire Malory had taken that ship so many years ago.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Eleven</i><br />


<small>A GREAT SECRET</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;We</span> been long enough getting here,&#8221; said Tom Trask, as
he dragged the prow of a small rowboat up the shaly
beach. &#8220;Are you sure this be Charlestown Neck, Johnny?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tugging away at the other side of the boat, Johnny Pettengall
answered him. &#8220;Charlestown, sure enough. Hold on.
Give me your hand. I got my foot caught in a patch of eel
grass or summ&#8217;at like.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom did as he was bidden, and in a moment the two were
climbing up a steep bank into the hayfield above. Just to their
left loomed a low hill, sharp on its eastern side. A taller,
more gently rounded hill stood up behind it, and through
the thick, fragrant grass around them a rail fence wound
away toward higher ground. Tom could see no lighted windows
anywhere.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ever been here before?&#8221; he asked doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Johnny, &#8220;but I come by here yesterday when I
was aboard our sloop that went up to the Penny Ferry to
meet the supply carts from the eastward. I had it pointed out
to me. This is Breed&#8217;s Hill just ahead of us, and Bunker
Hill&#8217;s behind.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>&#8220;Charlestown&#8217;s said to be a village,&#8221; Tom continued to
object. &#8220;I can see orchards, and what looks like a brick kiln
over there, and by the smell there&#8217;s clay pits somewhere
about. But I don&#8217;t see any houses at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Town&#8217;s the other side of the hill,&#8221; Johnny reassured him.
&#8220;Come on. We got to get to the Bay and Beagle before
Ma&#8217;am Greenleaf locks up for the night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Uncertain and on his guard, Tom followed his companion
up the slope through the firefly-studded grass. More than a
week now, he and the Newburyport lad had been sleeping at
night with their feet toward the same campfire&mdash;when they
did sleep&mdash;sharing the same ration of salt pork and corn
meal. He had not gone back to Medford after they burned
the <i>Diana</i>, for he and Johnny kept telling themselves that
they would borrow a boat and row over to Charlestown to
see the girls, but not until tonight had they been able to get
away. They had not wasted their time, though. They had
gone with the raiding parties that constantly scoured the
islands all the way from Chelsea Neck to the deep sea. They
had helped to burn Tory barns and steal Tory cattle. Tom
felt he could give a good account of himself when he got back
to his own company, but he was not so sure Captain Moore
would consider it a good account. He was even more dubious
about the attitude of the Colonel, his old friend, Johnny
Stark. That they were old friends wouldn&#8217;t make any difference
at all, when there was business in hand.</p>

<p>Yes, tonight after he&#8217;d seen Miss Kitty again and stolen a
kiss or two, he thought he&#8217;d better make for Medford, with
or without young Pettengall. Maybe he&#8217;d better ask now
just what his companion intended to do.</p>

<p>At that moment they reached the crest of Breed&#8217;s Hill and
paused to look down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Them lights over there must be Boston,&#8221; Johnny told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
him. &#8220;You ever been there, Tom? I heard it&#8217;s the greatest
city in North America. The best anyway.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t know we had any other cities,&#8221; said Tom, grinning
in the darkness.</p>

<p>Johnny took him seriously. &#8220;Course we have,&#8221; he hastened
to protest. &#8220;There&#8217;s New York, and Philadelphia where the
Great Congress meets. Some others further south, I guess,
and all of &#8217;em sending help to Boston. There&#8217;s talk they&#8217;ll
even send their soldiers here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe it when I see them,&#8221; said Tom skeptically. &#8220;But
you ask me, and I say no, I never been to Boston. I live a
sight of a ways off, you know, up the Merrimack.&#8221;</p>

<p>They stood there together a moment in the starlight and
cool sea wind, the sweetness of ripe hay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Johnny. &#8220;You didn&#8217;t go back there, ever&mdash;after
we got news of Concord Fight, did you? Ain&#8217;t you got
some folks waiting for you to come home?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom shrugged. &#8220;Folks is all dead,&#8221; he told Johnny.
&#8220;Won&#8217;t nobody miss me. Well&mdash;maybe a girl or two.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he spoke more quickly and in a lighter tone. &#8220;But I
know where I will be missed, I bet, and that&#8217;s back in Medford.
My company was less than half full strength when I
left, and I better be getting myself over there. How about
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to be in Cambridge, I guess, with Captain Little&#8217;s
company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Moses Little? Heard he&#8217;d been made a colonel, just like
Stark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were starting down the hill now, toward a cluster of
roofs and gables with a tall spire in the midst of it, toward a
shadowy line of wharves along the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know sure enough about Johnny. I was there in the
tavern when we chose him by a show of hands. They say some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
voted twice. I know I did. He was my neighbor up in Derryfield.
I worked in his sawmill some and went hunting with
his son Caleb. Caleb&#8217;s a right smart lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was harder going down Breed&#8217;s Hill than going up, for
the western side was as steep as the eastern, and they had to
hold back. There were stone walls to climb, and the dew-wet
grass was hard to wade through, but Tom scarcely noticed
that. Funny, he thought, as he heard his tongue run on, how
he never had very much to say, unless it was about John
Stark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Johnny&#8217;s the man for you,&#8221; he was saying. &#8220;Once
when the Indians captured him and put him to hoeing their
fields, he cut down the corn and left the weeds standing.
When they made him run the gantlet, he whacked them as
he went through, instead of t&#8217;other way. Kept singing while
he ran that he&#8217;d kiss all their women. He never liked the
British either, after he fought beside them at Quebec. &#8217;Fore
I was high as a rail fence, I heard him say we&#8217;d have to fight
against them sometime. There was folks who laughed at him,
but I guess they ain&#8217;t laughing now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we be,&#8221; said Johnny as they came to the beginning
of a street that led past the darkened windows of Charlestown.
&#8220;I got no idea where the place is. Likely there&#8217;ll be a
horse and a dog on its sign.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Charlestown was no very extensive metropolis, and
after a little wandering through its dim lanes and uncobbled
streets, they found the tavern they were seeking. The door
stood open to let in the night breeze, and the two boys
stepped uncertainly through.</p>

<p>A few candles burning in iron holders lit the dim taproom.
Clean mugs and glasses stood neatly on shelves behind the
bar, and the long brown braid of tobacco leaves hanging near
it swayed gently in the draft from the open door. Tom
thought that the braid looked like a cow&#8217;s tail. He made up a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
face when he remembered the pipeful of tobacco he&#8217;d had to
smoke the night they burned the <i>Diana</i>. Here was one customer
of Ma&#8217;am Greenleaf&#8217;s who wouldn&#8217;t ask her to cut off
a few inches for him, that was sure. But where was Ma&#8217;am
Greenleaf? Or Kitty? Or the other girl? The room was
empty, so far as he could see.</p>

<p>Johnny, too, was looking around him. &#8220;Don&#8217;t see where
they could have gone to,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;and left the door
open and the lights burning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just at that moment there came an anguished wail from
somewhere overhead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it! Oh stop! You&#8217;re killing me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robbers!&#8221; gasped Johnny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Or them British devils!&#8221; cried Tom, looking desperately
for the staircase. He finally saw it, winding up from a little
alcove that led to the kitchen, and in a flash he and Johnny
pounded up the narrow treads, bursting breathlessly into a
long hall at the top. From a room on the side toward the
river emerged another half-stifled cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;In here!&#8221; shouted Tom, flinging the door open.</p>

<p>Then he stood quite still. The sight before him was such
a one as he had never seen by the falls of Derryfield.
Johnny&#8217;s astonished gasp told him that his friend was as taken
aback as he.</p>

<p>Sally Rose Townsend sat precariously on the edge of a
four-poster bed, her face flushed and distorted. Granny
Greenleaf stood in front of her, her hands busy about the
girl&#8217;s dress&mdash;except that Sally Rose wore no dress. Her
shoulders were bare and gleamed whitely in the candlelight,
but her entire body below her shoulders seemed to be shut up
in some sort of cage. The cage gapped apart in the middle to
show an expanse of some white fabric underneath. It was
gripped firmly together at a point just above the girl&#8217;s waist,
and again below.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Sally Rose,&#8221; Gran was muttering. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
get this foolish contrivance apart, and there isn&#8217;t a locksmith
left in town. I believe there&#8217;s a blacksmith, though. We&#8217;ll
send Kitty to fetch the blacksmith. Mercy, where is Kitty? I
never thought of her before. Where has Kitty gone?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick! Cover me up, Gran!&#8221; gasped Sally Rose frantically,
her breath short, her words not quite clear.</p>

<p>Gran glanced backward over her shoulder. Then she
turned completely round and faced the intruders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Johnny Pettengall! And you&mdash;&#8221; she peered closer, &#8220;the
thief who made off with my son&#8217;s musket! What are you
doing in the bedchamber of a decent lass?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t mean no harm, Ma&#8217;am Greenleaf,&#8221; explained
Johnny. &#8220;We just came from camp to see the girls, and
walked into the taproom like&mdash;like anybody would. Then we
heard Sally Rose scream she was being killed&mdash;&#8221; He broke
off and stared again at the bent golden head of his adored
one. Sally Rose was beginning to weep tears of embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; replied the old lady grimly. She stood protectingly
in front of her granddaughter. After a moment she
seemed to come to a decision. &#8220;Well, since you&#8217;re here, you&#8217;re
here. And it&#8217;s plain some male critter will have to help us.
&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t as if the girl weren&#8217;t decently covered underneath.
Can you boys get her out of that contraption?&#8221;</p>

<p>Johnny swallowed and made inarticulate sounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can try,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;What is it? What&#8217;s it made of?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pair of stays. An outlandish pair brought from New
York for some Tory hussy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mother&#8217;s stays are laced together,&#8221; said Johnny, his
embarrassment lessening a little. &#8220;Won&#8217;t they come off if
you unlace them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cut the laces&mdash;first thing I did when I came upstairs and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
heard her moaning,&#8221; snapped Gran. &#8220;But these are fastened
with locks at top and bottom. Come and look at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gran motioned the boys forward and they gingerly approached
Sally Rose.</p>

<p>Tom reached out coolly and fingered the jeweled padlock.</p>

<p>Sally Rose sucked in her breath and closed her eyes.
Johnny looked the other way.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could force it apart,&#8221; said Tom thoughtfully, &#8220;but it&#8217;s
too small for me to get a grip on. What we need is a file. You
got one about the place somewhere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does your father keep a tool chest handy?&#8221; demanded
Gran of Sally Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think&mdash;in the barn&mdash;out the back way through the garden,&#8221;
Sally Rose whispered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go find it, Johnny,&#8221; ordered Tom.</p>

<p>Johnny dashed for the stairway, and the Derryfield lad
walked to the window and stood there with his hands behind
him, gazing into the summer night. Nothing could be done
until Johnny came back, and he had no wish to embarrass the
poor girl further by staring at her.</p>

<p>He looked at the gable windows of the house across the
street, and then down the narrow way that led to the market
place. Then he craned his neck at what he saw, and felt a
little smile crooking the corners of his mouth. Miss Catherine
Greenleaf was coming hot-foot home from somewhere, and
he guessed he&#8217;d see she got a proper welcome. He turned
back to Gran who still stood in front of Sally Rose, tapping
her slippered foot on the pine floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think I&#8217;ll go help Johnny hunt for the file,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He stepped into the taproom of the Bay and Beagle just as
Kitty entered from the street. He had the advantage, for he
had expected the meeting. She stopped still and gave a little
gasp, but he spoke calmly enough.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>&#8220;You ought to stay to home when you have company, Miss
Kitty,&#8221; he rebuked her mildly.</p>

<p>Kitty recovered herself quickly, lifted her head, and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I would have,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if I had known.
Wherever did you come from?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit here,&#8221; he said, and drew her down beside him on the
wide ledge that ran under the window. &#8220;I come from Chelsea
Neck on my way back to the camp in Medford&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you&#8217;re going back to camp?&#8221; she interrupted him.</p>

<p>He looked at her keenly. Something was the matter with
her. She was all upset like, but trying not to let him see. He&#8217;d
thought to steal a few kisses, but he felt pretty sure she wasn&#8217;t
in the mood for kissing. Too bad. Well, another night,
maybe. He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think likely they can use me there. I been away
driving cattle off the islands the last week or two. Met up
with Johnny Pettengall and he told me you was here. Tonight
we borrowed a boat and rowed over the Mystic. But I
didn&#8217;t see you anywheres as I come across Breed&#8217;s Hill and
through the town. Where you been tonight, Kitty?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him thoughtfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that&mdash;but
maybe I ought&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here &#8217;tis!&#8221; cried Johnny triumphantly, rushing into the
room with a small iron file in his hand. He paid no attention
to Kitty. &#8220;Come on, Tom! Let&#8217;s go file Sally Rose!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom waved him away with a flippant gesture. &#8220;You go file
Sally Rose,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She&#8217;s your girl. I got business with
Kitty.&#8221; He turned his back on the other lad.</p>

<p>Kitty put her hand to her mouth. &#8220;Oh, I forgot!&#8221; she
gasped. &#8220;Sally Rose is still in the stays!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough she is,&#8221; agreed Tom. &#8220;Johnny&#8217;s got a file,
and he can shave the lock away. I asked you where you&#8217;d
been tonight, Kit. Walking out with some other lad, maybe.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
No moon, but it&#8217;s sweet-aired and warm. A good courting
night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty sat twisting her hands in her lap and did not answer.
Johnny made a pitiful noise of dismay and turned reluctantly
toward the staircase.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Gran?&#8221; asked Kitty.</p>

<p>Tom smiled widely. &#8220;With Sally Rose,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Likely
to stay there awhile, wouldn&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, of course. She wouldn&#8217;t leave Sally Rose like that&mdash;and
with Johnny. I&mdash;I&mdash;&#8221; she stopped again.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s on your mind, Kitty? Something, I can tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Yes, there is. I don&#8217;t know&mdash;maybe I should&mdash;or
maybe I should wait and tell Sally Rose first. But maybe
you&#8217;re the one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You better tell me,&#8221; he said, trying to put strength into
his voice, and a little tenderness, but not too much. He
didn&#8217;t want her breaking down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said after a moment, lifting her head and looking
straight into his eyes. &#8220;Yes, I think I should probably tell
you, for you&#8217;ll know what to do about it. If you&#8217;re going
back to camp&mdash;it ought to be made known to the officers
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I aim to go tonight, not tomorrow morning,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;Say what&#8217;s got to be said, Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well then, I will.&#8221; She was not looking at him now. She
fixed her eyes on a candle burning in a sconce across the room.
&#8220;Tonight I went out to meet&mdash;a man&mdash;who was expecting
Sally Rose. You can see why she couldn&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>

<p>He grinned. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Sally Rose ain&#8217;t geared right
now to travel far. Who was the man? Oh&mdash;I bet I know&mdash;that
redcoat she took such a notion to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it was Gerry. Captain Gerald Malory of the Twenty-third.
I did see him, and he warned me. He told us to get out
of Charlestown, for the British are about to strike.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Tom leaned forward. &#8220;When?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any night now. By the end of the week, surely. Here, or
in Dorchester. Gerry wasn&#8217;t sure. But if it should be Bunker
Hill&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bunker Hill would be a right handy site for them to
hold,&#8221; muttered Tom. &#8220;We thought they was about ready to
go. But before this we had no real word.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent for a moment. Then he laid his hand over
hers. Then he stood up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess I better make for camp,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is important
information you got here. I&#8217;ll carry the news straight to
Stark. He&#8217;ll be the man to tell. He&#8217;ll know what steps to
take. You was smart, Kitty, to tell me. May make a big difference&mdash;to
both sides. Don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ve got a horse
about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed we have,&#8221; cried Kitty, relieved that she had told
her disturbing secret and eager to be of further help, if that
were possible. &#8220;There are two horses in the barn that belong
to Uncle Moses Chase. Sally Rose and I brought them from
Newburyport. Gran says they&#8217;re eating their heads off, but
she hasn&#8217;t sent them home. But they&#8217;re only plow horses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Kind I&#8217;m best used to. Like the gun, I&#8217;ll see you get it
back some day.&#8221; He stroked the blunderbuss that now accompanied
him everywhere. &#8220;Don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll see you again
Kitty. Not here, likely. If the British are aiming to come this
way, you folks will have to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we will. Just as soon as I can talk to Gran and Sally
Rose. Back to Newburyport, perhaps. Why don&#8217;t you come
to see us there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell. Looks like I&#8217;ll have some fighting to do first.
Glad you took our side and told me that British fellow&#8217;s secret,
instead of hiding his little plan for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>A startled look came over Kitty&#8217;s face. &#8220;Why&mdash;why, I did
betray Gerry, didn&#8217;t I? I&mdash;I never thought of it like that.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>&#8220;&#8217;Course you betrayed him. You&#8217;re too good a Yankee to
do aught else, as I can see. Good-by, Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He strode into the kitchen on his way to the garden and the
barn behind it.</p>

<p>The last thing he heard was a triumphant squeal from
Sally Rose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Colonel John Stark of the New Hampshire line was not in
his quarters that night, but walking among the tents on the
hillsides above Medford, talking with his men. After the
long ride from Charlestown, Tom Trask felt weary and
breathless when he finally caught up with his old neighbor.</p>

<p>The colonel stood in a grove of oak trees where a little
brook drained down. All along the brook the crude sailcloth
tents clustered very thick. Campfires were burning low now.
Some of the men lay sleeping on the ground beside them.
Others were playing cards, jubilant when they could fling
down the ace to take the queen. Stark was talking with a
couple of grizzled veterans who had fought beside him in the
Indian wars, but he broke off when the younger man came
panting up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you been, lad?&#8221; he asked, and clapped Tom on
the shoulder. &#8220;Couldn&#8217;t believe it when Moore reported you
missing. Shut up in gaol, maybe? I know you got some good
reason for being away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom could not bring himself to look at the keen blue-gray
eyes and sharp, viselike face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I been raiding the islands with some of Putnam&#8217;s men,&#8221;
he muttered. &#8220;But on my way back tonight, I heard a word
in Charlestown you ought to know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You got no business raiding islands, nor being in Charlestown,&#8221;
snapped the colonel, all the warmth and friendliness
gone from his voice. &#8220;Get back to Captain Moore, and tell
him where you been. He&#8217;ll deal with you.&#8221; He turned away.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>Tom nerved himself to step forward and pluck the sleeve
of Stark&#8217;s new blue uniform.</p>

<p>&#8220;Colonel Stark, sir,&#8221; he stammered. &#8220;You know what I
heard in Charlestown? It come straight from a British captain,
what I heard.&#8221;</p>

<p>The colonel turned toward him again. &#8220;What was it?&#8221; he
demanded.</p>

<p>Tom lowered his voice. No use in alarming the men. &#8220;Oh,
a very great secret it was, told in confidence to a girl. This
captain said that the British mean to move out of Boston
before the week&#8217;s end. They mean to seize and fortify either
Dorchester Heights or Bunker Hill.&#8221; He paused expectantly.</p>

<p>John Stark uttered a mirthless ha-ha.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Seems like you be about the forty-first
private to come up and tell me that. The word&#8217;s spread wide,
from here to Jamaica Plain.&#8221; Then he shook his head. &#8220;Too
bad you done what you done. I&#8217;d ha&#8217; liked to ha&#8217; recommended
a sergeant&#8217;s knot o&#8217; red for your shoulder when I
sent you back to Captain Moore.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Twelve</i><br />


<small>THUNDER IN THE AIR</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> bells were sounding midnight in Medford Steeple,
turning Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, when
Tom Trask tied his borrowed horse to a nearby fence and lay
down beside the dying campfire of his own company. After
the rebuke by his colonel and another one next day by Captain
Moore, he hardly expected John Stark to send for him
within a day or two, but that was what came about.</p>

<p>Stark was holding a conference with a handful of his captains
in the little hollow between Plowed Hill and Winter
Hill. It had probably been a green valley once, but now the
young grass was all trampled away, and so was a field of
what had started out to be Indian corn. All about stretched
the tents and crude wooden shelters of the New Hampshire
men. The colonel was in his shirt sleeves, and his lean face
looked grimmer than usual. He had no smile of greeting, but
he did not seem to be angry any more.</p>

<p>&#8220;See you brought your horse, Tom, like I said. Was surprised
when &#8217;twas reported to me you owned such an animal.
They&#8217;re scarcer&#8217;n hen&#8217;s teeth around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only borrowed him, sir,&#8221; replied Tom quickly. &#8220;Borrowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
him in Charlestown. He belongs in Newburyport.
When I can, I mean to return him home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t hurry about it,&#8221; replied the colonel. &#8220;See that cart
over there?&#8221; He pointed to a heavy wagon, empty, three
young men standing close by. A horse was fastened between
the shafts of it, but he was a lank, ill-favored nag and looked
scarce able to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then take your critter over to help the other one pull.
General Ward has promised to issue some lead to us, if we
send to Cambridge for it. That&#8217;s Peter Christie, Hugh Watts,
and Asa Senter who are going with you. Good lads. I knew
their folks in Londonderry before I was grown. Be as quick
as you can about it, too. We haven&#8217;t got enough powder and
ball to scare off a herd of deer, let alone the British Army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Tom again. He waited for further instructions,
but none were forthcoming. Colonel Stark turned back
to his worried-looking officers. After a moment Tom led his
horse over to the wagon.</p>

<p>The Londonderry men were indeed good fellows, he soon
found out, used to the same life as he. They had fished in the
same streams and hunted over the same mountains, knew as
little about books and high living, as much about how to plant
corn or cut down a white pine so it would fall the right way.
And soon they were all singing crude old-fashioned country
songs as they drove along the winding road.</p>

<p>Tom looked westward across the pleasant farms to the
faint blue line of hills beyond them, and he thought of the
unseen army that was supposed to be circling tightly all
around Boston, an army of men like himself and the Londonderry
boys. Some said it was ten thousand strong, and
some said twenty, all the way from Medford River to Jamaica
Plain. He thought of that other army, swaggering
through the streets of Boston; men, he supposed, like that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
redcoat captain he&#8217;d brought home in chains a while back&mdash;and
nobody knew what strength they had. He remembered
Kitty&#8217;s warning that the British meant to strike by the week&#8217;s
end. Well, here it was, Friday, June sixteenth, and the
weather hotter&#8217;n the burning roof of hell. If the British were
coming, they&#8217;d better be on their way. Maybe they were on
their way. Everybody in camp was worn out and restless with
expecting them, but nobody seemed to know.</p>

<p>Just then his horse gave a neigh, laid back its ears, and
stood still. Perforce, the other horse halted, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;Must ha&#8217; seen a rabbit,&#8221; said Hugh Watts, peering over
the side of the cart into the thick grass that grew beside the
road. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything but ripe strawberries, though.
Think we could stop to pick a few?&#8221;</p>

<p>Asa Senter shook his head. &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t hardly dare it,&#8221; he
objected. &#8220;Stark wants us to go and get back. By the look o&#8217;
the sun, it&#8217;s already six o&#8217;clock, and we still got about another
mile.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom leaped down from the wagon. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it was a
rabbit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He acts more like there was thunder in the
air.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a cloud anywheres that I can see,&#8221; said Peter Christie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t have to be.&#8221; Tom patted the horse&#8217;s flank and
started to lead them ahead. &#8220;If there&#8217;s thunder somewheres
over back, a critter&#8217;ll always know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Feel a bit uneasy myself,&#8221; said Asa, getting down to walk
beside Tom. &#8220;Look! There&#8217;s a steeple and some roofs sticking
up through the trees. Cambridge must be just ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were a sight of mighty fine houses round Cambridge
Common, Tom thought, as they approached it. Big square
mansions, some of them; some with gambrel roofs, mostly
painted yellow and white. But he didn&#8217;t see any of the sort
of folk who looked as if they lived in the houses; pretty
women with flowers and jewels, or gentlemen in velvet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
jackets wearing swords. The roads that led to the Common
were thronged with soldiers like himself, in cowhide shoes,
leather breeches, and tattered tow-cloth shirts, with bandanas
round their heads; and all too many, for his taste, had
a short-stemmed pipe gripped between their teeth. They all
seemed to be excited about something.</p>

<p>He had no trouble in getting the old Hastings house
pointed out to him, but he was unable to lead his horse anywhere
near it because the crowd was so great. They seemed to
be having some sort of muster on the Common, for men were
drawn up in rank there, maybe a thousand or so.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a-going on, Tom?&#8221; Peter demanded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;but I aim to find out. You
boys stay here with the cart, and I&#8217;ll go over to General
Ward&#8217;s and ask. We got to go there anyway to get the lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>He left his companions and made his way forward till he
reached the rail fence before the dwelling house that had
been pointed out to him as the headquarters of the Great
American Army. A row of Lombardy poplar trees stood up
tall and pointed behind the fence, and just as Tom elbowed
his way to the gate, a man came out to stand before the wide
front door.</p>

<p>First there was a loud shouting, and cheers, and then a
hush. The seething mass of men around Cambridge Common
stood very still.</p>

<p>The man in the doorway was not General Ward, surely,
for he wore a long black gown with flowing sleeves and a
square-topped cap such as Tom had never seen before, with a
tassel hanging down. But two other men stood behind him in
blue coats and three-cornered hats, and they were officers,
right enough.</p>

<p>However it was the black-clad man who spoke, loudly and
clearly, so that as many as possible might hear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>&#8220;I, Samuel Langdon, President of Harvard College, am
here to assure you that the hearts of our little community go
with you in your heroic venture. With you go the hopes of
Massachusetts, and the future, perhaps, of our whole great
country. I am here to bless your going out and your coming
home. May His strength uphold you when your need is greatest,
His spirit restore you when you falter, and His truth
abide in you always. My sons, let us pray.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom whipped off his cap, bowed his head, and closed his
eyes, aware that hundreds of other men were doing the same.
But his throat tightened and he heard no more of President
Langdon&#8217;s prayer. This was the beginning, he thought. Concord
Fight hadn&#8217;t been anything to what this would be. At
Concord Fight they had all come a-running, just the way
men come when the word goes out that a house is afire. But
this was like when a whole town got together by plan and
moved out against the French or the Indians. Concord Fight
had been a fight&mdash;just that&mdash;but this wouldn&#8217;t be a fight,
what was coming now. It would be a battle. It would be a
war.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori</i>,&#8221; finished Dr.
Langdon soberly. &#8220;It is sweet and fitting, my sons, to die for
one&#8217;s country.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his eyes and stood silent, looking over the heads
of the company, straight at the small square bell tower of a
church across the way.</p>

<p>Everyone began to talk at once, it seemed, and in the uproar
Tom thrust open the gate that led to the Hastings house
and crossed the lawn to the back door. Lilac trees grew close
to it, and here, away from the glare of the sinking sun, the
air was fragrant and cool. A young man in a trim blue coat
sat at a table just inside the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lead for Colonel Stark?&#8221; he replied to Tom&#8217;s question.
&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s to have a supply our men cut out of the organ pipes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
in the English church across the Common. Trouble is, I can&#8217;t
think for the minute where &#8217;tis stored. Suppose you come back
tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom pulled a tendril off a grape vine that grew on a trellis
over the door and began to chew it. &#8220;Stark wants me to bring
it back tonight,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The young officer sat up and surveyed him insolently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stark may not know it, but there&#8217;s a war beginning,&#8221; he
announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; agreed Tom. &#8220;There is. That&#8217;s what he wants the
lead for.&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly they were both laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right, man,&#8221; answered the young officer in a
friendlier tone. &#8220;We&#8217;re all on edge, and it takes us different
ways, I guess. But I still don&#8217;t know where the stuff has got
to, and I&#8217;m afraid we can&#8217;t do anything till Prescott takes his
force out of town, which he&#8217;ll do as soon as it&#8217;s dark enough.
Come back a little after nine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Prescott going?&#8221; Tom asked.</p>

<p>The officer laid his finger across his mouth. &#8220;Prescott
knows&mdash;and nobody else has any need to. Have you got
rations, lad?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;we come empty-handed. Three others
besides me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The officer wrote rapidly on a slip of paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here. Take this to the head of the Common when you
hear them blow a bugle up there. Give it to the mess sergeant,
and he&#8217;ll see you have some supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Tom. He went back to where he
had left his companions.</p>

<p>He found them sitting along the top rail of a fence while
the horses cropped the wayside grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you find out what&#8217;s afoot, Tom?&#8221; asked Hugh Watts
eagerly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>The men in the streets were thinning out, but those on the
Common, though no longer drawn up at attention, still remained
there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a war beginning, and nobody knows where
the lead is,&#8221; said Tom, flinging himself down on the grass.
&#8220;Didn&#8217;t find out a thing beyond that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We did,&#8221; said Asa. &#8220;After the man got through praying,
we asked around. Seems Colonel Prescott&#8217;s taking out twelve
hundred men with packs and blankets and a day&#8217;s ration.
There&#8217;s a fatigue crew along, and picks and shovels like they
mean to fortify. Nobody knows where.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll either be behind Dorchester or Charlestown,&#8221; said
Tom. He thought fleetingly of Kitty, and the yellow-haired
minx, and the gallant old woman. He hoped they&#8217;d got safe
away, but he didn&#8217;t think of them long. &#8220;There&#8217;s the bugle,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go get supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>Supper in Cambridge camp that night, for such men as did
not have regular rations, consisted of a slab of salt fish and a
hunk of hard, grayish bread, served with a noggin of sour
beer. After the boys had eaten they walked about the town,
down to the red brick buildings of the college, filled now with
soldiers instead of scholars, and into the gray flush-board
English church to see if by any chance the lead was still there.
The church was full of Connecticut men who were using it
for barracks, and they knew nothing about the lead at all.</p>

<p>By nine o&#8217;clock the twilight had gathered thickly about the
little town, and the men on the Common formed in ranks and
began their march. Two sergeants walked ahead carrying
dark lanterns, half open so as to throw the light behind. Then
came two blue-coated officers, Colonel Prescott and Colonel
Gridley, then the rest of the detail, made up of Massachusetts
and Connecticut men. Tom was not surprised when he
saw that they took the Charlestown Road.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>&#8220;Bet they&#8217;re going to fortify Bunker Hill,&#8221; he told his
friends. &#8220;They&#8217;re carrying entrenchment tools. Wouldn&#8217;t
bother with them if the British had already struck. Must be
we mean to get there first and beat them to it. You go back to
the cart, and I&#8217;ll call round at headquarters again. We got to
get that lead and start for Winter Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>The town had quieted down now, and most of the men remaining
there had gone to the houses where they were quartered,
or to their tents in the fields beyond. Nobody would do
much sleeping, Tom thought. Tense and nervous they all
felt, trying to tell themselves they were too much men to be
afraid&mdash;just like any flesh and blood thing when there was
thunder in the air.</p>

<p>Two lanterns were burning on poles set up in the yard of
the Hastings house, but the back door was locked when Tom
rapped on it. So was the front door, when he tried to enter
there. Through the window he could see candles burning in
prismed holders, and a group of men sitting around a mahogany
table, some in uniforms, others in buff and gray and
bottle green coats. One of the officers stood up to speak. He
was heavily built, with pointed features and bright eyes, but
his face had an unhealthy look. Must be Ward himself,
thought Tom. All the Army knew their leader was a sick
man.</p>

<p>&#8220;When the Committee of Safety advised me this afternoon,&#8221;
he began, &#8220;that it was deemed best for us to fortify
Bunker Hill&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a sentry tapped Tom on the shoulder with a gun
barrel. &#8220;What are ye lurking about for?&#8221; he growled in a
rough voice.</p>

<p>Tom turned around sharply. The sentry was an oldish
man, unshaven, with shaggy hair and beard.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got business here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I come to get Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
Stark&#8217;s lead, and by the great Jehovah, I mean to do the
same.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentry spat. &#8220;Maybe ye&#8217;re honest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ye look
to be. But General Ward&#8217;s a-talking to some important men
from the Congress o&#8217; Massachusetts right now. Couldn&#8217;t let
ye in there if ye was King George himself, with the Queen
tagging along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait here till they&#8217;re through then,&#8221; insisted Tom.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll wait right here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sentry shrugged. &#8220;Guess there&#8217;s no harm in that,&#8221; he
muttered, and ambled off.</p>

<p>Tom sat down on the grass with his back against a poplar
tree and looked up at the stars. They were just as bright as
they had been when he crossed Breed&#8217;s Hill a few nights
ago. He wondered if tomorrow he&#8217;d be going back there,
lugging Kitty&#8217;s old blunderbuss with him. Suddenly he realized
that he was sleepy. The tension had eased out of him,
even though there was still thunder in the air, the thunder of
war about to break. A man could only keep himself keyed up
for so long. But it wouldn&#8217;t do&mdash;now&mdash;to go&mdash;to sleep. He
ought to get up and walk&mdash;get&mdash;up&mdash;and&mdash;walk&mdash;</p>

<p>He opened his eyes and shook himself. How did it get to
be like that&mdash;early morning, the light as broad as day? The
sky was red and golden over eastward where the sea must lie.
The grass around him was wet with dew. Smoke was curling
upward from the chimneys round about, and in somebody&#8217;s
barnyard he could hear a rooster crow. Lord forgive him,
he&#8217;d slept all night. They&#8217;d drum him out of camp or at least
give him forty lashes, and he deserved it, too.</p>

<p>He stood up just as a horse and rider came spurring to the
gate. The rider dismounted hastily and approached the front
door. He was a trim, neat man with fair hair, but he looked
feverish and ill. Almost immediately a pint-sized man came
out to let him in. The two shook hands.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>&#8220;Ah, Elbridge, Elbridge Gerry, my good friend,&#8221; murmured
the newcomer. &#8220;It is folly to try to seize and hold
Charlestown. Yet, I must go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah no, Dr. Warren,&#8221; pleaded the smaller man. &#8220;You are
too well known. You stayed in Boston too long, and the
British know too well what a great pillar of strength you
have been to our colonial cause. As surely as you go up
Bunker Hill, you will be slain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; answered the doctor tensely. &#8220;I told the friends
with whom I dined last night that I would go up the Hill
today and never come off again. I slept wretchedly, and my
head aches, but after an hour or two&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sirs,&#8221; interrupted Tom politely, &#8220;I am sorry to bother you
when you&#8217;re about such weighty business, but I been here
since six o&#8217;clock last night, trying to get some lead for Colonel
Stark.&#8221;</p>

<p>Elbridge Gerry gave a snort of impatience, but Dr.
Warren turned and smiled at the boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry you had the long delay, lad. I myself saw that
the lead was dispatched to Stark late yesterday afternoon.
He&#8217;ll know what to do with it, if anybody does. His men will
have melted it into bullets by now, and may be shooting it at
the British, for all I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned again to Mr. Gerry. &#8220;Ah, sir, &#8216;<i>Dulce decorum</i>,&#8217;
as all men know or must learn. Let us go inside, and send
someone to lead my horse away, for he is as spent as I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom walked thoughtfully back to where his comrades
would still be asleep in the empty cart. &#8216;<i>Dulce decorum</i>&#8217;! He
knew what the Latin meant, for President Langdon had
translated it yesterday afternoon. &#8220;It is sweet and fitting to
die for one&#8217;s country.&#8221; But was it, he wondered. The sun felt
gloriously warm on his back, and made his blood tingle.
The birds were singing in the elm trees round the Common.
Kitty was a pretty girl, and there were other pretty girls.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
Sweet to die? That sounded like a thing old men would think
of, tired old men who never had to go out and fight, who
would die in bed at ninety-three or so. Still, if you had to do
it, you had to do it, and he guessed he was as ready as he&#8217;d
ever be.</p>

<p>Over towards Charlestown he heard the boom of a heavy
gun.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Thirteen</i><br />


<small>THE WORLD TURNED UPSIDE DOWN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Gerry Malory</span> was back in Devonshire at daybreak on
that hot June morning, only it did not seem to him to be
morning, or any special time of day. He stood in a low valley
opening toward the sea, and there were little farms all around
him with hedgerows in between them, and here and there a
church spire reaching toward the sky. He was not alone, for
a man stood beside him, a man he had never seen before,
about his father&#8217;s age, dressed in quaint old-fashioned clothes,
and carrying an ancient gun. The gun looked like the one
that belonged to the Yankee that had taken him prisoner in
the tavern by Ipswich Green. The man was shaking his head
and scowling. He seemed to be angry about something. Gerry
was ready to protest that he hadn&#8217;t done anything wrong,
when suddenly he thought that maybe he had. Maybe he&#8217;d
been poaching again.</p>

<p>Just then the man spoke. &#8220;It&#8217;s the coming country, lad,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t make the mistake I did in my time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What mistake?&#8221; Gerry murmured, but he thought he
knew. His words were drowned out by the deep boom of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
thunder. Again and again the thunder sounded, and the
echoes rolled over valley and hill and sea.</p>

<p>His body shook like an aspen in a storm wind; his eyelids
snapped wide apart. He was in the warehouse behind the
stables near Long Wharf in Boston, Massachusetts, and Sergeant
Higgs had him by the shoulder. The thunder still
boomed in his ears, but the Devon landscape had gone back
into his memory, where it probably came from. He was lying
on his own blanket on a heap of straw, with the regiment&#8217;s
goat tethered nearby.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wake up, lad! Don&#8217;t you hear the guns?&#8221; Higgs was
saying.</p>

<p>Gerry pulled himself erect. He found it hard to come out
of the dream that had seemed so real to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I hear them,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Whose guns are they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose would they be?&#8221; scoffed the sergeant. &#8220;Do you
think the Yankees have guns like that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;no.&#8221; He was wide awake now, wider awake than he
wanted to be, he thought, for the cannonading sounded ominous
and near. &#8220;What&#8217;s happening, Jack? Are we marching
against them? Have we attacked&mdash;or they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell yet,&#8221; said Sergeant Higgs. &#8220;All we know is, we
hear gunfire. Lieutenant Apthorp has gone to headquarters
to find out. You better get some breakfast. It&#8217;s best we be
ready for anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the cobbled square outside, the men of the Twenty-third
had built their usual cookfire, just as they did every
morning, and gathered round it, salt pork spitted on bayonets
and stale bread handed round by the mess sergeant. Lieutenant
Apthorp did not come back, and Lieutenant Julian went
to see what was keeping him. The cannonading went on. It
was coming from the ships in the river beyond the North
End, most of the men agreed. Maybe the Yankees had got
together some sort of raft and were moving by water against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Boston. The Twenty-third seemed more amused than frightened
at this suggestion.</p>

<p>And then, without any official announcement being made,
the word was passed from mouth to mouth, and everybody
knew.</p>

<p>The Yankees had taken the hills above Charlestown in the
night, and built some sort of entrenchment there. They were
being fired at from three sides by the British men-o&#8217;-war, but
it began to seem as if this would not be enough to dislodge
them, as if a force would have to go out and drive them from
the hill.</p>

<p>In the town behind him Gerry could hear the rattle of
artillery carriages, the thud of horses&#8217; hoofs as the dragoons
galloped here and there. General Gage had called for his officers
to meet at the Province House, and some of the men
went off to hover about that grim, narrow structure and get
the word as soon as it was handed down.</p>

<p>Gerry did not go to the Province House. He went to the
edge of the wharf and sat there, dangling his legs over the
side. The sun was getting higher and hotter, and he looked
up at the sun, and then down at the thick grayish water lapping
silently round the piers below. He thought about his
dream, and he thought about the girl called Kitty, who was
not so distractingly fair as Sally Rose, and wondered if she
had got safe away. He thought about Captain Blakeslee lying
dead under the locust tree. True, he had never wanted to be
a soldier, but once he became one, he&#8217;d expected to bear his
part well. Once he&#8217;d have been eager to march out when he
heard firing, but he was none so eager now. Maybe he was
afraid. Maybe that was a bad omen. He&#8217;d heard around the
campfire that men who were going into their last battle often
felt that way. If only he could forget the dream....</p>

<p>The sounds of confusion in the town behind him seemed to
increase and grow. Now that he thought of it, none of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
usual daily noises could be heard: not the tapping of the carpenters&#8217;
hammers, nor the thumping of handlooms, nor the
creak of wooden machinery. The little Negro boys were nowhere
about with their cries of &#8220;Sweep oh! Sweep oh!&#8221; He
suspected that the town of Boston would do no work this day.
Everywhere men were shouting and bells were ringing:
Christ&#8217;s Church with its royal peal, the North Church with its
sour note, and half a dozen more. Just as usual, the breeze
that blew over Long Wharf smelled of fish and whale oil and
the nearby stables, of tar, and spice, and wood smoke, but
now, or did he imagine it, it had an acrid brimstone tang.</p>

<p>At eleven the men came trooping back, and the word was
out. Every man knew what was to be the order of his day.</p>

<p>At half past eleven the men of Gerry&#8217;s company paraded
on the Common, splendid in scarlet and white and brass,
equipped with full kit, blankets, and three days&#8217; rations, and
drawn up beside them were fifteen hundred more. The ships&#8217;
guns still roared away, and every now and then a terrible
blast let go from the battery on Copp&#8217;s Hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say it&#8217;s only a handful of farmers,&#8221; muttered Jack
Higgs. &#8220;I&#8217;d not think they could stand such punishment for
long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry looked at Boston Common, the rambling field that
had become so familiar to him in the past year: the crooked
cowpaths, and the little pond, and the thick clumps of juniper
and steeplebush, so handy to come upon when you were
walking in the moonlight with a girl; the gravel strip where
the officers still raced their horses, in spite of all the town
fathers could do. He looked at the gabled mansions and
quaint, crooked houses round, as if he never expected to see
them any more.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Yankees&#8217;ll take more punishment than you&#8217;d think
for,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>Once on the water, the barges from Long Wharf joined
with the barges from the North Battery, twenty-eight of
them moving in two long parallel lines, filled with scarlet-coated
men. In the leading boats were two polished brass
field pieces, and the noonday sun struck everywhere on colorful
banners and gleaming arms. For the Tories in Boston, it
must have been a splendid sight, but Gerry turned his eyes
toward the Charlestown peninsula as the troops were rowed
across the blue bay.</p>

<p>Smoke and flame and awful sound kept pouring forth from
the great guns of the fleet&mdash;the <i>Somerset</i>, the <i>Falcon</i>, the
<i>Lively</i>. Dimly through the barrage he could see the little
village where he had gone drinking at the Bay and Beagle
and courting in the graveyard under the spring moon. On the
hill above it, grown up overnight like a mushroom, stood a
small square earthworks, silent, except for one erratic cannon
that spoke now and then. Black dots of men moved about the
earthworks, but no columns issued forth drawn up in battle
array, no reinforcements poured in from any side.</p>

<p>Gerry&#8217;s spirits rose and he cleared his throat. &#8220;Is that,&#8221; he
asked the sergeant, &#8220;the great fortification we&#8217;re all ordered
out to tear down?&#8221;</p>

<p>The sergeant laughed grimly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t look very fearsome,
does it?&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But after the way they run us back
through Lexington, I don&#8217;t trust them devils.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I thought it was Bunker Hill instead of Breed&#8217;s
they&#8217;d be likely to fortify,&#8221; went on Gerry. &#8220;That&#8217;s how we
would have chosen. But that&#8217;s Bunker Hill, standing up
behind there, bare as a plate. The little dugout is on Breed&#8217;s
Hill, below.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Breed&#8217;s or Bunker makes no difference now,&#8221; said Sergeant
Higgs. &#8220;Keep your cartridges dry in the landing.
We&#8217;re headed in towards shore.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>A few minutes later they were all drawn up in a low-lying
field where Charlestown peninsula extended, pear-shaped,
into the sea. Gerry found himself in the front line, far to the
right, with the light infantry of the Twenty-third and the
King&#8217;s Own. To the left stood the grenadiers, and behind
him the Fifty-second and the Fifth. He was feeling cheerful
and brave now, and as safe as London Tower. It reassured
him even more when the order came to break ranks and dine
on the rations in their knapsacks before going farther along.</p>

<p>Sprawled in the hot sun, chewing his beef and biscuit, he
eyed the landscape round him: the green, sloping fields, some
cocked hay, and some standing grass; the swamp and brick
kilns to the left; Breed&#8217;s Hill above, where the black dots
still crawled around the tiny redoubt. He talked with the
other men.</p>

<p>All the young lads, he found, were in their glory that the
attack was to be made straight on, that this detachment of the
British Army would pound forward full force and set the
Americans running, or beat them down into their native clay.
But the old wise sergeants shook their heads and said it was
a pity Gage hadn&#8217;t ordered them to land at the Neck. They
could have bottled up the Yankees in Charlestown then, and
starved them out, and not had to fire a shot.</p>

<p>No, somebody else said, for to do that would have meant
sending a force between two wings of its enemy, and that was
a tactic frowned upon long before Caesar marched through
Gaul. In the end they all agreed that they were well enough
satisfied with the way things had fallen out. They&#8217;d march
up that hill in double-quick time, drive the cowardly Yankees
out of their burrow, and be back drinking beer in Boston
before the sun went down.</p>

<p>They were beginning to take out packs of dog-eared playing
cards when the word passed among them that reinforcements
were disembarking on the fields to the left; that Howe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
had sent for the reinforcements because the Americans were
bringing in more troops, the earthworks had been extended
far to the left, and he didn&#8217;t like the looks of things at all.</p>

<p>Gerry began to put his uneaten food away in his knapsack.
There wasn&#8217;t as much room in it as there should have been,
because at the last moment he had decided to stuff in the
rough shirt and breeches he wore when he went about the
Yankee countryside. He smiled now, as he saw them there.
Didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d have a need for them, but you never know.
Just then the bugles sounded and the officers called them to
attention. Like one man the assembled army was on its feet.
Gerry could see the newly landed troops drawn up away to
the left, facing the redoubt.</p>

<p>General Howe, dark, florid and heavily built, stood forth
and spoke to his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I am very happy to have the honor of commanding
so fine a body.... I do not doubt that you will
behave like Englishmen and as becometh good soldiers. If
the enemy will not come from their entrenchments, we must
drive them out, otherwise the town of Boston will be set on
fire by them.... I shall not desire one of you to go a step
further than where I go at your head. Remember, gentlemen,
we have no recourse, if we lose Boston, but to go on board our
ships ... which will be very disagreeable to us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>General Howe stepped a little aside and stood smiling
proudly round him, his hand on his sword. The troops stood
tensely, bayonets in hand, waiting the order to move ahead.
The cannonading from the ships was so steady that they did
not hear it any more, but the guns of Boston now set up an
iron clamor that seemed fit to shake the earth. Now the artillery
rolled toward the redoubt.</p>

<p>Gerry looked up at the serene blue sky, at a cluster of apple
trees a little way ahead. There were trees like that on his
father&#8217;s farm in Devon, and he wondered if he&#8217;d ever again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
see them growing there. He looked at the hill where spouts
of dust shot upward as heavy balls hit the turf of the redoubt.
Suppose they did have to board their ships and sail away?
Maybe he wouldn&#8217;t sail away, maybe he&#8217;d go and find blue-eyed
Kitty. Maybe he would....</p>

<p>The artillery seemed to have slowed and faltered, bogged
down in the miry earth at the swamp edge, crushing the
blue flag lilies as it moved forward again. At last came the
order the scarlet host had been waiting for.</p>

<p>Gerry gripped his bayonet and stepped out as he had been
trained to do. A rippling field of buttercups and daisies lay
ahead, and beyond it a rail fence, but he saw no likely danger
there. He glanced toward the redoubt where General Pigot
was to lead the attack. Howe would march on the rail fence
that joined a stone wall running to the waterside. Then
Howe&#8217;s regiments and the light infantry would shatter the
Yankees&#8217; left and sweep across it, swinging inland to overwhelm
the earthworks from behind. It seemed like an unbeatable
plan.</p>

<p>The light infantry, men from the Welsh Fusileers and the
King&#8217;s Own forged steadily ahead&mdash;but not easily. The day
was growing hotter. What with ammunition, food, blankets,
and firelocks, they were weighted down a hundred pounds to a
man. Gerry felt the sweat burst out on his face. He wished
he had a drink. He wished he could run his finger under the
stiff leather stock that gripped his throat. He wished he could
rip off his beaver hat. Clouds of black smoke with white
under-edges were billowing up to the west of Breed&#8217;s Hill.
Looked like Charlestown Village was afire. Well, Admiral
Graves had wanted to burn it long ago.</p>

<p>He waded through the thick grass, almost to his knees,
then out on a muddy strip of beach littered with driftwood
and small dead creatures of the sea. Here they halted briefly
to re-form.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>Grouped now in columns of fours, the Welsh Fusileers in
the lead, the light infantry advanced along the narrow strip
of shore. They drew close to the rough fieldstone wall. That
it had been hastily thrown up, Gerry could see now. Undoubtably
there would be Yankees behind it. He half lifted
his bayonet. They drew nearer and nearer. They were ready
to deploy and charge, when the blast came.</p>

<p>The low stone wall seemed to leap forth at them in a searing
torrent of fire. Like corn before the scythe, the men on
both sides of him went down. More from shock than anything
else. Gerry fell on his knees, but he lifted his gun and
fired once from there. Where the bullet went, he never knew.
Crouched in the foul-smelling mud, he tried to load again.
Wounded men lay all around him. His own company seemed
to be cut to pieces, but the King&#8217;s Own tried to form a charge
and went streaming through. Again the tide of flame leaped
forward. The scarlet line, broken in many places, reeled back.
Again the officers rallied what was left of them, and again
the charge came on. The whole world seemed to be dissolved
in blood and fire, the cries of the wounded, the shouts of the
officers, and the steady roar of the guns upon the hill.</p>

<p>He tried to pull himself upright, but just then he felt a
terrible blow against his head. His ears rang. Stars and circles
swam before his eyes, orange, green, and rainbow-hued. He
seemed to be no longer a living thing, only one huge dull
pain sinking into darkness.</p>

<p>He did not know how long it was before the darkness
streamed past him and away, and he saw the stone wall
abristle with smoking gun barrels. He lifted his head from
the mud and gazed in the other direction. To his horror he
saw the scarlet backs of his comrades fleeing helter-skelter
toward the barges by the shore. He lay all alone, in the midst
of the dying and the dead. One man was calling for a drink
of water, and another man gasped out a prayer. Shattered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
muskets, ripped knapsacks, and the discarded wigs of the officers
littered the beach about him.</p>

<p>His head throbbed and seemed to be swelling larger every
minute, big as the sun itself, the sun that still glared down
from the pitiless blue sky. He couldn&#8217;t think clear, and he
knew he&#8217;d have to think clear, if he ever got out of this alive.</p>

<p>Finally he lifted up his head and saw a steepening of the
river bank just ahead of him that made a sort of bluff he
could try to crawl under. Inch by inch, painfully, he dragged
himself among the fallen men. Most of them lay quiet now
and were not troubled by his passage through. They would
never be troubled by anything any more. They had not
beaten the Americans, but they would never board the ships
and sail away.</p>

<p>Once under the safety of the bluff, he lay there and sipped
a little of the brackish water which he scooped up in his hands.
There was blood on his uniform, and blood was trickling
down from somewhere over his left ear, but he did not put
his hand up. He did not want to know how badly he was hurt&mdash;not
right now.</p>

<p>And yet, his own wound wasn&#8217;t the worst of it. The worst
of it was the sight of the British Army running away. Running
to the barges, fleeing back to Boston, beaten almost to
destruction by a mob of American farmers at a stone wall and
an earthworks on a hill! What was that old tune the band
played sometimes on parade? <i>The World Turned Upside
Down!</i></p>

<p>What would happen to him, he wondered, when the
Yankees found him lying here? They didn&#8217;t have bayonets,
most of them, so they couldn&#8217;t run him through, but there
were other ways to kill a man.</p>

<p>But maybe they wouldn&#8217;t, all of them, kill a wounded
man, any more than he would. He&#8217;d gone among them, traveled
through their towns, and found there men no worse<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
than he. And at that he remembered the knapsack and the
clothing in it. He reached down; yes, it still hung at his side.</p>

<p>Painfully, haltingly, he pulled off the ruined uniform, the
muddy scarlet and blood-stained white. Then he lay there
naked in the mud a little while, under the bluff of sun-baked
clay, till he had gathered strength enough to pull on the
country clothes, the garb of most of the men behind the
American line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe&mdash;if they find me&mdash;they&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m one of
theirs,&#8221; he muttered, &#8220;take me in with their own wounded
and bind my head up&mdash;and never know.&#8221; He managed a
weak smile. The last prank he&#8217;d ever play on the Yankees,
he guessed, but it was worth a try.</p>

<p>Somehow he managed to crawl up the bank and out on the
bloody grass. He lifted his eyes toward the redoubt. Could
he believe what he saw? It had redcoats swarming all over it,
their bayonets drawn, struggling on the parapet with the
Americans, leaping down on those below.</p>

<p>&#8220;So the lads have come back,&#8221; he whispered faintly. &#8220;We
aren&#8217;t beaten after all. I should have known it couldn&#8217;t be&mdash;not
Howe and Pigot! Not the Fusileers and the King&#8217;s Own.&#8221;</p>

<p>He tried to get to his feet, but he couldn&#8217;t because his head
was too big and heavy. His head was as big as the whole
world. His head was drifting away on a tide of darkness that
swept by.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Fourteen</i><br />


<small>THE YOUNG MAY DIE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> did not know what time it was or how long she had
been asleep. She only knew that she was wide awake
now, somewhere in the empty black middle of the night, and
she could hear Gran&#8217;s voice from the taproom below.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be an officer, young man,&#8221; Gran was saying,
&#8220;furthermore, you may have come all the way up here from
Connecticut, but I&#8217;m not impressed with that. I&#8217;m not one of
your soldiery, nor obliged to take your orders. This is my
son-in-law&#8217;s house, and the taxes upon it paid. I mean to stay
here till he orders me from it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty leaped out of bed and ran to the head of the stairs
where she could hear better.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only for your own safety, Ma&#8217;am,&#8221; a harassed young
voice was explaining. &#8220;There&#8217;s going to be all hell to pay here
tomorrow morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve been telling me,&#8221; went on Gran calmly, &#8220;and
in that case, I&#8217;d better get some sleep to be ready for it. Good
night, young man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty heard the slamming of the front door. She crept
downstairs.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>Gran was methodically taking all the best silverware out
of the chest and wrapping each piece separately in flannel.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Gran?&#8221; asked Kitty. She drew her
flimsy nightrail around her and stood there shivering.</p>

<p>Gran went on sorting out porringers and teaspoons.
&#8220;There&#8217;s going to be trouble, child,&#8221; she said. &#8220;The town&#8217;s
full of soldiers, and there&#8217;s more soldiers digging some sort
of burrow above us on the hill. They say by daylight we can
expect shooting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are they British soldiers?&#8221; asked Kitty. After all, Gerry
Malory had warned her, and she had passed the message on,
telling Gran it was something she had heard in the street.
Gran had scoffed at the idea, refused to be driven away.</p>

<p>&#8220;British! No! They be still drinking and gambling in Boston,
and like to stay there till the blast of Gabriel&#8217;s horn, if
you ask me. These soldiers are our own lads, and they sent
the word about that since they&#8217;ve entrenched themselves on
a hill the British wanted, they look for a battle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If&mdash;if there is a battle, what will we do?&#8221; asked Kitty.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do what is needed,&#8221; said Gran shortly. &#8220;Right now
I want you to wake Sally Rose. Put on your oldest dresses and
good stout shoes. No flounces and toothpick heels, mind. Pick
up whatever valuables you have and bring them to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose, still sleepy-eyed, was enchanted at the prospect
of adventure. She brought a whole little chest full of
trinkets when they returned to the kitchen. Kitty had only
her mother&#8217;s cameo brooch, and she pinned that inside her
bodice. Gran held out a willow basket full of the carefully
wrapped silver.</p>

<p>&#8220;You girls take this down to the graveyard and bury it,&#8221;
she ordered. &#8220;If the British come pouring in here tomorrow
morning, looking for what they can find, new-turned earth
in a graveyard will occasion no comment.&#8221; Across the lid of
the basket she laid a wooden shovel.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>Carrying the basket between them, the girls picked their
way through the town in the warm, dim starlight. Here and
there they passed by little groups of men who seemed to be
patrolling the streets, who looked at them curiously but uttered
no challenge. Lights were burning across the river in
Boston and on the masts of the <i>Somerset</i> lying at anchor in
mid-channel. Cries of &#8220;All&#8217;s Well!&#8221; sounded faintly at intervals
from its decks and from the sentries in the town beyond
it.</p>

<p>There were no lights or sentries apparent on Bunker Hill,
nor yet on Breed&#8217;s, when they looked that way, but both hillsides
seemed to be alive with moving masses of shadow; a
low hum rose above them like the swarming of many hives
of bees. Now and then there was a tiny flash of light, or a
clang as a shovel hit against stone.</p>

<p>Kitty dug a shallow pit under the flowering quince tree
where she had talked with Gerry Malory, and Sally Rose
helped to cover it over, once the silver and her own treasures
lay safe inside. Then they hurried back to the Bay and
Beagle. Gran was trotting about the kitchen, setting many
pans of bread to rise, pulling down hams from the rafters,
heating the bake ovens red hot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get to work, girls,&#8221; she said as they came in, handing
Kitty a carving knife and Sally Rose a wooden spoon. &#8220;Can&#8217;t
tell how many men we may have to feed tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they finished the preparations she considered necessary,
they sank down exhausted on benches drawn to the oak
table. Kitty noticed that the hands of the tall old clock
pointed to a quarter past three.</p>

<p>&#8220;My soul and body,&#8221; said Gran, &#8220;I thought I&#8217;d learned to
do without it, but a cup of tea would certainly taste good to
me right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose smiled and her eyes sparkled in the candlelight.
&#8220;I can get you tea, Gran,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Father has some hidden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
away. He says he keeps it for times of need among womenfolk.
&#8217;Twas bought long ago before tea-tax time. Put the
kettle on, Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went flying into the taproom to the secret cache behind
the bar. A little later they sat down again with steaming cups
before them.</p>

<p>But Gran&#8217;s face was sober, and she spoke more gently than
was her wont to do. &#8220;I hope that whatever happens tomorrow,&#8221;
she said, holding her teacup in her hand, not tasting
the fragrant liquid, &#8220;you girls will behave in a fitting
manner, though it may not be easy. There is bound to be
much danger about in a battle, and many horrible sights to
be seen. When the soldiers came here first and warned us to
go away, I thought I would do as they advised me. And then
I remembered an old great-grandmother of mine. She lived
in a lonely garrison and when the Indians attacked her home,
she did not run away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did she do?&#8221; asked Sally Rose, her eyes wide.</p>

<p>&#8220;She poured boiling water out of an upstairs window and
scalded the varmints,&#8221; snapped Gran, with all her usual
severity. &#8220;And if she could do that, it came to me that I could
stay here and do whatever it was needful I should do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think to pour hot water on the British, Gran?&#8221;
asked Kitty, trying to suppress a giggle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Times change,&#8221; said Gran, her eyes fixed on the dwindling
darkness outside, on the tall hollyhock stems becoming
visible in the garden, &#8220;and that&#8217;s not what will be expected of
us, most likely. Only&mdash;it comes to me&mdash;that sometime, a
good many years from now, all of us, yes, even you, Sally
Rose, will be great-grandmothers, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With gray hair?&#8221; asked Sally Rose plaintively.</p>

<p>&#8220;With gray hair&mdash;or no hair at all,&#8221; continued Gran.
&#8220;And then, at that time, we wouldn&#8217;t want the young folk of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
our blood to say we were afraid and ran away when the time
of danger came.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked challengingly at the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Kitty soberly. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t want that. But
what will we do, Gran?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t tell for certain. But the way I see it, we keep a victualling
house, and when there&#8217;s a lull in the fight, if a fight
there be, the men will want food and drink. We&#8217;ll be here to
provide it for them. All we have to do is the thing we do
every day&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>A low boom like thunder, and yet sharper and more explosive
than thunder, rolled and echoed in the direction of
Morton&#8217;s Point. A moment later the windows rattled and
the tavern shook.</p>

<p>Gran covered her ears and closed her eyes. &#8220;Merciful
heavens, it&#8217;s begun! I&#8217;ll have to eat my fine words now!
Under the table, Kitty, Sally Rose!&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment they were huddled together on the floor, with
the spreading trestles round them and the stout oak planks
above. The blast was followed by a silence, and in the silence
they heard a derisive shouting from the crest of Breed&#8217;s Hill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sounds like the lads up there had suffered no harm from
it,&#8221; murmured Gran, her voice a little steadier now. &#8220;That
was a cannon shot, I think; most likely from one of their
ships. I really doubt they&#8217;ll come ashore. Perhaps it would
be safe&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The cannon boomed again. Now another cannon spoke out,
a little to the left. Then another. There were no silences any
more, only the steady booming, and with every fourth or
fifth boom, the tavern shook. One after another the windowpanes
began to shatter. Once they heard a great crash in the
street.</p>

<p>They did not speak to each other, for no human voice
could penetrate the din. Kitty watched a streak of sunlight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
slowly widen and move across the floor. It told her that time
was passing, and that this was a clear, bright day.</p>

<p>After awhile a lull did come, and the cannonading died
out into silence. The silence was broken by a heavy knocking
on the street door.</p>

<p>Gran&#8217;s eyes snapped and her face hardened. &#8220;&#8217;Pon my
soul, no stranger is going to catch me hiding under a table,
cannon or no cannon&mdash;nor my granddaughters, either. Kitty,
go and see what&#8217;s wanted.&#8221;</p>

<p>She got to her feet and smoothed her apron. Sally Rose
followed her and stood still, her eyes wide with fright, her
lips trembling. Kitty went to open the door.</p>

<p>A gnarled old man stood there, holding a wooden bucket
in each hand. He pointed to the tavern sign and then opened
his mouth in a toothless grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lass,&#8221; he inquired, &#8220;are ye doing business today?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Kitty steadily. &#8220;I guess we are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good. Will ye fill these pails with water for me. The lads
has need of it on the Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; said Kitty. She took the two pails through the
kitchen to the garden well. When she returned with them,
there were half a dozen other men waiting, and they wanted
water, too.</p>

<p>The guns began again with a new fury. Gran and Sally
Rose had stepped into the garden, and when Kitty returned
there after the men had gone, she found them staring up the
hill.</p>

<p>A small, square earthworks stood on the green crest that
had been bare at twilight. Small figures of men were working
all around it, digging up turf, building it higher, stringing a
wooden fence in front. Other men passed to and fro over
Bunker Hill and the highroad that led to the Neck. Every
now and then a column of dust shot skyward as a cannon ball<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
plowed into the earth. But the men who were busy about the
earthworks paid no attention to the cannon balls.</p>

<p>Now and then there would be a moment&#8217;s pause in the
firing, and that gave Gran and the girls a chance to speak to
one another.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on up there, and where are the British?&#8221;
demanded Gran. &#8220;Did those water boys bring you any news,
Kitty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just as you thought,&#8221; said Kitty hurriedly, knowing
that the guns might interrupt her at any moment. &#8220;The ships
are firing at us from all three sides. The lookouts say there&#8217;s
a commotion in Boston, but it&#8217;s too early to tell yet what they
mean to do. They say there are about a hundred people left
here in the town, but there&#8217;s such heavy firing across the Neck
they doubt that we can get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then there came a hail from the kitchen doorway,
where a man stood with two empty water buckets. Gran went
to talk with him herself, this time. When he had gone, she
spoke her mind to the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nobody up there&#8217;s got time to be hungry, it seems, and
they&#8217;ve plenty of strong drink amongst them, but two of their
great hogsheads have been shot open, and the need&#8217;s for
water. Sally Rose, you stay by the windlass and keep turning.
Kitty, you carry the pails to the taproom to save the men the
journey out here. Fill every tub and bucket and keep them
full. I&#8217;m going to the roof to see for myself whatever there
is to be seen.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to the two girls that the morning would last forever,
as the sun toiled upward toward noon. Sally Rose
ground at the windlass and swung the heavy buckets over the
stone curb where Kitty&#8217;s hand received them and carried
them inside. Round and round, back and forth, round and
round, less like women of flesh and blood than like two
parts of some wooden machine. They did not talk much together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
They had not the breath for it, nor very much to say.
Now and then Kitty looked up the hill to the earthworks, the
tiny, gallant redoubt. The men were still toiling to reinforce
it, and a man in a blue coat strolled fearlessly along the parapet
as if he were telling them what to do.</p>

<p>It was about noon by the kitchen clock when Gran came
down stairs. Her face was grim. &#8220;Girls,&#8221; she said tensely,
&#8220;leave your work and come with me. I want you to see a
shameful sight. I want you to see the King&#8217;s soldiers coming
out with guns against the King&#8217;s loyal people.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Bay and Beagle was a square-built house of red brick,
three stories tall, with a white railing about its flat roof. Gran
led the girls to the side facing Boston, half a mile away. Kitty
gripped the rail with both hands, though she would have
liked to put them in her ears, the cannonading had become so
much louder, the spaces between the blasts so brief and few.
Sunlight sparkled on the blue river and on the three great
ships pouring forth constant broadsides of fire. Flames leaped
forth from Copp&#8217;s Hill, from floating batteries in the ferry
way, and over all hung a mist of grayish white smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look there,&#8221; hissed Gran during a quiet interval, quiet
except for the jangling bells of Boston that were doing their
best to make their steeples rock.</p>

<p>Kitty and Sally Rose let their glances follow her pointing
finger, to the docks that lined the opposite shore. Two lines
of barges were moving out on the full tide, one from Long
Wharf, and one from the North Battery. They rode low in
the water, being full to the gunwhales with soldiers clad in
white and vivid scarlet. The sunlight gleamed on the steel of
bayonets, on the brass mountings of the great black guns. It
was a gorgeous and yet a terrible sight.</p>

<p>All Boston seemed to go mad with the frantic clamor of
bells. Shouts and cheers rose from its crooked streets that
wandered up hill and down, and somewhere a band was playing.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
Its rooftops were black with tiny figures who had climbed
there to watch the King&#8217;s troops move against the King&#8217;s
people who felt they had always been loyal to him&mdash;so far.</p>

<p>When the two rows of barges reached midstream they
drew near to each other and then moved forward in two long
lines, side by side, like pairs of marching men. They seemed
to be headed for Moulton&#8217;s Point. Kitty watched them till
they passed out of sight around a curve of the shore. Then
she turned to face Gran and Sally Rose.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do&mdash;do you think they&#8217;re going to land?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sakes alive, child,&#8221; answered Gran, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
they mean to do, but we&#8217;ll go back downstairs and see if we
can find out. There are sure to be more men coming after
water.&#8221; She glanced up the hill toward the redoubt. Only a
few figures moved about it now, but clouds of dust rose
everywhere, thrown up by the impact of cannon balls, and
the smoke from the guns themselves drifted that way. At that
moment a handful of men appeared on the top of Bunker
Hill, coming from the direction of the Neck. More men followed
them, and still more. In orderly fashion they marched
toward the redoubt where they were greeted with a faint
cheering.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like more of our lads had come to help,&#8221; said
Gran, as she led them down the narrow stairs and into the
taproom. Just as she had suspected, three water carriers
waited there, and all the pails and tubs were empty.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gran,&#8221; whispered Sally Rose, &#8220;I&mdash;I just don&#8217;t think I
can turn that windlass any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gran looked at her keenly. &#8220;It makes the arms ache, I
know,&#8221; she said with surprising sympathy. &#8220;Kitty, you go to
the well for a while, and let Sally Rose carry the buckets.&#8221;</p>

<p>And thus their morning chores began all over again,
though it was already early afternoon.</p>

<p>At the end of her third trip between well and taproom,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
Sally Rose stopped to talk to Kitty in one of the rare intervals
when no gun was going off.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kit,&#8221; she said wanly, &#8220;I&mdash;I&#8217;m frightened, Kit. Do you
think Gerry&#8217;s coming in one of those barges? Do you think
he&#8217;ll have to shoot at our lads on the Hill? Do you think he
might shoot at me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty had been wondering almost the same thing, but she
would not tell her cousin so.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re going to think about a lad at a time like this,&#8221;
she said, &#8220;why don&#8217;t you think of Johnny? You&#8217;ve gone about
with Johnny for a long time, Sally Rose, and Johnny&#8217;s on our
side. Don&#8217;t you wonder if maybe he isn&#8217;t up there&mdash;in that
earthworks on the Hill? Right there in the thick of the
cannon balls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I do wonder about Johnny,&#8221; she answered plaintively,
&#8220;and about Dick, even about that New Hampshire
boy with no manners&mdash;Tom what&#8217;s his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty, too, had wondered about Tom, but not too much.
There was a cold certainty in her heart that Tom Trask
would be in the thick of whatever fighting there was to come.
She knew that as well as if she could see him there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls!&#8221; called Gran&#8217;s voice from the kitchen door. &#8220;Girls!
come here to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty let go the windlass suddenly, and the handle spun
creaking round. Sally Rose set down her pail.</p>

<p>Just then there was a loud whine somewhere overhead, and
then a whoosh, a shower of splinters about them, and a roaring
wind that flung them hard against the turf. For a moment
they lay there, not daring to move. The smell of burning
powder filled the air. Then another roaring wind went by,
but not so close, and higher overhead.</p>

<p>Kitty sat up. A cannon ball was bouncing across the grassy
yard of the house next door. It had passed through the garden
and shattered the pointed roof of the well-house where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
they stood. She reached out and grasped Sally Rose by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quick,&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;Let&#8217;s get inside. They&#8217;re firing
into the town, not just at the earthworks any more.&#8221;</p>

<p>Racing into the taproom, they found Gran in talk with a
tall man who wore an officer&#8217;s coat and three-cornered hat
and did not carry a pail.</p>

<p>&#8220;Girls,&#8221; said Gran, her voice frighteningly calm, &#8220;the British
have landed, and &#8217;tis plain they mean to charge the Hill.
Whether they can take it or not, we don&#8217;t know. But they&#8217;re
shooting straight into Charlestown now, iron balls and iron
cases full of burning trash. The town&#8217;ll soon be in flames over
our heads. &#8217;Tis time to leave. There&#8217;s nothing more we can
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>A moment later they were in the street outside, trailing
along after a sorry-looking group of men and women, poor
folk, mostly, who had stayed in town in spite of all the warnings
of danger, because they had nowhere else to go.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; murmured Gran as they plodded over the
cobblestones, their eyelids smarting and their throats choked
with the thick smokiness that seemed to be flooding over the
whole world, &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we sent Timothy to Cambridge, two
days back&mdash;Timothy and that poor horse, too. At least, we&#8217;re
leaving no living thing behind to burn.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty thought of all the living things who were left to their
fate in that tiny fortress on the Hill.</p>

<p>Iron shot blasted the roofs about them, and balls of living
flame burst in the street. All along their way the old wooden
houses were beginning to catch fire. Just as they passed out
of town and into the green country at the rear of Bunker
Hill, Kitty looked back. Clouds of black smoke billowed upward
from the docks, the warehouses, the dwellings, the
shops in the market square. The church steeple lifted up one
soaring pyramid of fire.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>Her eyes hurt suddenly with tears that did not come from
the smoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come away, child,&#8221; said Gran, putting her arm about the
girl&#8217;s shoulders, using her other hand to guide the half-blinded
Sally Rose.</p>

<p>How far they had gone before the little procession came
to a halt, she did not know, but she did know they toiled a
long way down the dusty road, constantly shelled by the
heavy guns of the ships.</p>

<p>When they did stop, it was in the front dooryard of a little
tavern, The Sign of the Sun. The raggle-taggle company scattered
themselves about on the grass, but Gran led the girls
inside.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say the firing&#8217;s too heavy for us to cross the Neck
and flee inland,&#8221; she explained, &#8220;but &#8217;tis to this place they are
bringing the wounded men. Perhaps we can help here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The taproom they entered was not unlike the taproom at
the Bay and Beagle, but tables and benches had been moved
back to clear the floor. Some dozen men in tattered shirts and
bloody breeches were lying on the wide pine boards. Some
moaned, and some lay very still. Three women worked
among them, and a man in a buff coat, a doctor, most like,
knelt by one soldier probing a wounded knee.</p>

<p>Gran looked around her. &#8220;There&#8217;s water and bandages on
the counter over there,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Get to work, Kitty, Sally
Rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>If the morning had seemed long, it seemed that that afternoon
at the Sign of the Sun would never go. Kitty knelt and
swabbed and tied bandages and held whiskey to men&#8217;s lips to
ease their pain when Dr. Eustis&#8217; probe went deep. Sally Rose
and Gran were doing the same thing, too.</p>

<p>Then the men came in so fast there was no room for them
in the tavern, so they were laid in the yard, and all about the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
garden reaching up the hill. The air was full of booming
sound and smoke, and over all burned the hot, hot sun.</p>

<p>The British had charged the Hill and been driven back,
she heard from the men she tended. The British had gathered
themselves together and were about to charge again.</p>

<p>She and Gran and Sally Rose were working over two men
with shoulder wounds, trying to staunch the flow of blood,
when Gran suddenly stood up and put her hand to her forehead.
A strange look came across her face. Then she smiled,
and the light in her eyes paled out and dimmed away.</p>

<p>&#8220;The young may die,&#8221; she murmured, &#8220;but the old must.&#8221;</p>

<p>She tottered and fell beside the soldiers on the bloody
grass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead. Stone dead,&#8221; muttered Dr. Eustis, kneeling above
her a few moments later. &#8220;Her heart failed from the shock
and strain of this day, I do believe. But she died with her
hand to the plow. She died like a good soldier.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sally Rose crouched on the steps of the tavern, put her
head in her lap, and burst into uncontrollable weeping. She
never moved from there the rest of the afternoon. After
Gran&#8217;s body was carried to a chamber over the taproom, Kitty
looked desolately about her for a few moments. Then she
went back to tending the wounded men. She would do what
it was needful for her to do.</p>

<p>Word came down the hill that the British were driving on
the redoubt, that powder horns were getting low.</p>

<p>Sometime after that&mdash;she never knew how long&mdash;Kitty
knelt beside the newest soldier to arrive. His head was
bloody, and he wore a rough shirt and breeches like all the
rest, but on his feet were the fine polished boots worn by the
men in the British Army. When she washed the blood away,
she found she was bending over Gerry Malory.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Fifteen</i><br />


<small>A TERRIBLE BLACK DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;We be</span> going down this hill now,&#8221; said Colonel John Stark,
&#8220;to fortify and hold the rail fence there.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood out boldly on the bold bare top of Bunker Hill,
his new blue and buff coat unfastened at the neck, his musket
held lightly but warily in his hand. His New Hampshire
troops were drawn up before him, farmers and woodsmen for
the most part, and dressed as befitted their callings. They
wore homespun shirts and breeches dyed in the sober colors
of late autumn, after the red and gold are gone. They carried
a variety of weapons: here a fowling piece made by a
village blacksmith; there an ancient queen&#8217;s arm left over
from the Siege of Louisburg thirty years ago; there a blunderbuss
older than Plymouth Colony.</p>

<p>Tom Trask, who carried the blunderbuss, looked past his
colonel at the whole of Charlestown peninsula spread out
before him in the early afternoon sun. Below, on Breed&#8217;s
Hill, that Prescott&#8217;s engineers had made the surprise decision
to fortify, stood the redoubt. He could look down into
it, just as if he were standing in the top of a tree. The men
had built wooden platforms to fire from, and they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
massed and waiting behind their guns. Farther down, on the
point of land between the sparkling blue rivers, the scarlet
pride of the British Army sprawled on the grass eating its
dinner.</p>

<p>Stark went on, his voice low but piercing, a tenseness in it
that made a man&#8217;s blood run hot with courage, rather than
cold with fear. He gestured toward the shores of the Mystic,
the side of the field away from Boston.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the left of the redoubt, lads, you can see a rail fence,
and Knowlton&#8217;s men have banked it with cut hay. But past the
rail fence there&#8217;s an open stretch along the river, wide
enough to drive a team of horses through. We&#8217;ll go down
there now and build a stone wall across it. Isn&#8217;t a man among
you don&#8217;t know how to build a stone wall.&#8221;</p>

<p>He paused and looked proudly around him. &#8220;And when
it&#8217;s built, we&#8217;ll take our stand there, there and along the
fence, and fight. If there&#8217;s a man among you don&#8217;t know how
to do that, he can go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>The road back to the safety of Medford lay broad and
smooth behind them, but nobody turned toward that road.
They started to cheer, but the colonel held up his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait till you got something to cheer for, boys,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;But remember this&mdash;all! Don&#8217;t shoot till they be within
fifty yards. Pick out the officers. Fire low, and aim at the
crossing of their belts. Hit for the handsome coats and the
commanders.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted his head and stepped back. Tom stood close
enough to see his burning eyes and the unflinching line of his
mouth. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how the rest o&#8217; you feel,&#8221; Stark went
on, &#8220;but for myself, I&#8217;ll fight to the last drop o&#8217; blood in me.
By the great Jehovah, I mean to live free or die!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fall in!&#8221; he shouted. He held up his arm and made a
swooping motion toward the rail fence. The New Hampshire
regiments followed him down the hill.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>Once on the narrow strip of muddy beach beyond the
fence, they worked desperately to rear a wall across it before
the British should come on. Some fetched stones from other
walls that divided the pastures on the hillside. Others toiled
to heap them in a bulwark straight to the water&#8217;s edge. Tom
was with those who carried boulders flung from the bank and
piled them ready to the builder&#8217;s hand. Once he climbed up
the ledge himself to take a look at the field above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Caleb,&#8221; he called eagerly, as he noticed a young
man standing where the rail fence ended, a musket in his
hand.</p>

<p>Colonel Stark&#8217;s first-born son, sixteen-year-old Caleb,
turned around and a grin broke over his lean face as he recognized
his old hunting companion. He stepped forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tom!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t seen you since you left
for Newburyport with the log raft, back sometime in the
spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I ain&#8217;t had a chance to get home. Ever since Concord
Fight I been in camp. Where you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Round home mostly. Just got here this morning. Word&#8217;s
gone all around the countryside that the British be about to
attack. Figured my dad could use another man. Say, Tom,
Jean&#8217;s been asking about you&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Fife and drum music burst forth from the red-coated
ranks below the hill, and the bugles uttered an urgent cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they come!&#8221; yelled Tom. He leaped down the
bank and ran to where he had left his blunderbuss, in the
center of the stone wall.</p>

<p>Crouched behind it, he watched the British come on. He
could not see the field above him that sloped upward to the
redoubt, and &#8217;twas likely the heaviest charge would be there.
But there were plenty of red coats and white breeches moving
toward the New Hampshire line. Once the attackers stopped
and reformed in groups of four. Then on they came.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>Just to his right a musket spoke, though they had received
no order to fire. Tom lifted his own blunderbuss, but before
he could pull the trigger Colonel Stark strode fearlessly between
the opposing armies. He had a tree branch in his hand.
With a sharp stab he thrust it into the earth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t another man fire till they pass this stake. Whoever
does, I&#8217;ll knock him down,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He looked around him to make sure his words were understood.
Then he walked back to his own line as calmly as if he
were going down to his sawmill on any summer afternoon.
Behind him the advancing British fixed their bayonets. He
leaped down into the shelter of the wall.</p>

<p>When the word came, Tom was ready, and his blunderbuss
spoke punctually as the British passed the stake. He could
not tell how many times he fired, and he did not stop to see
what damage he had done. Aim, fire, load. Aim, fire, load.
He kept relentlessly on, scarce conscious that all around him
other men were doing the same. He knew that the ground in
front of the stone wall was covered with wounded and dying
redcoats, but their line kept still coming on, and so long as it
did, he would do nothing but fire, load, aim.</p>

<p>As he had been told, he aimed at the handsome coats and
the commanders. Once when he lifted his eyes to choose the
next target, he saw, to his utter amazement, a man he knew.
Captain Gerald Malory was advancing toward him, bayonet
in hand. As he looked, his amazement turned to contempt.
&#8220;Polecat!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Said he was captain. Done it to
dazzle the girls, I&#8217;ll warrant.&#8221; Gerald Malory wore a private&#8217;s
uniform. Turning away deliberately, Tom leveled his
gun on a resplendent major. When he looked back again, his
one-time prisoner was gone.</p>

<p>The British line wavered and fell back. He could hear the
shouts of the officers trying to rally their men. They lifted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
their guns and fired a volley, and Tom heard the shots
whistle high above.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gunning for hen hawks, maybe,&#8221; he told himself with a
grin. &#8220;Won&#8217;t hit nothing else that high in air.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the red-coated line was drawing back, retreating
down the beach toward the point from whence they had come.
Now there were no redcoats within firing range any more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; said Tom. He put down the blunderbuss and
mopped his forehead. Now he took time to look around him.</p>

<p>All along the New Hampshire line men were standing up
to stretch, drinking water out of leather bottles, and beginning
to move about and talk together. He did not know the
grizzled oldsters on either side of him, but he soon learned
they were veterans of the Indian War, and no strangers to
powder and shot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think they&#8217;ll be back?&#8221; he asked, waving his thumb in
the direction of the retreating British.</p>

<p>His companions nodded. They were starting already to
reload.</p>

<p>Down at the open end beside the water lay a confused heap
of wounded. Those who could still stand up and walk were
helping to carry their less fortunate fellows away. The word
went round that a hospital had been set up at The Sign of
the Sun, a tavern on the back side of Bunker Hill.</p>

<p>There came a hail from the bank above. Tom turned that
way and recognized the shaggy gray head and sturdy figure
of Old Put. The general was mounted on a horse, and had
several other blue-coated officers with him. Colonel Stark
and three of his captains strode over to the bank, and the two
commanders talked for a long time. Then Stark walked resolutely
back to the stone wall, with his head lifted, his gaze
fixed straight before him. Old Put&#8217;s party rode off toward
the redoubt.</p>

<p>A bugle sounded far down on Morton&#8217;s Point. Once again<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
the British must be coming on. Tom crouched and leveled
the blunderbuss. Just then the man on his left leaned over
and spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Word&#8217;s gone down the line,&#8221; he muttered through a
thick wad of tobacco, &#8220;that Johnny Stark&#8217;s lost his boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Caleb? How?&#8221; gasped Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stopped a British ball somewheres up by the fence, they
say.&#8221; The man spat brown juice on the trampled mud. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
like the look o&#8217; things, lad. My powder horn&#8217;s getting low.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So&#8217;s mine,&#8221; said Tom numbly. He looked between the
stones at the oncoming scarlet line. He knew the depth of
quiet love that lay between that father and son. &#8220;When they
told Stark&mdash;what did he say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Said he had no time now to talk o&#8217; private affairs,&#8221;
answered the veteran. &#8220;Look there, in the front ranks of &#8217;em!
That&#8217;s General Howe. I fought under him at Quebec in &#8217;59.
I&#8217;d know him anywhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom looked where the other pointed, but he did not see
the proud pompous figure of the British general leading on
his men. He saw instead a New Hampshire mountainside in
the fall, young Caleb Stark walking under the golden beech
leaves, with his head up, laughing in the crisp air. He saw
Caleb skating on Dorr&#8217;s Pond in the winter moonlight; pitching
hay on a summer afternoon. And now at the rail fence
Caleb lay dead. By Jehovah, he&#8217;d fix the British for doing
that to his friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here they come, lad,&#8221; warned the man at his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; said Tom. He gripped the blunderbuss, and
all his rage and vengeance sounded in the roar of it as it
spoke.</p>

<p>The British were not so easily beaten back this time. Stepping
over their fallen comrades they marched up to the wall,
staggered back at the withering blast of fire, and came on
again. But at last their officers could no longer urge them forward.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
Once more Tom found himself staring at the redcoats
fleeing away.</p>

<p>It was a long time before they formed again, and the whole
American line was jubilant. It began to seem as if a handful
of farmers with nothing but courage and gunpowder had
turned back the British Army. Tom climbed up the bank in
the interval and took a look at the redoubt. It was untaken,
and there were still, red-clad forms lying all over the
slope before it, and the gleaming brass of abandoned artillery.
In front of his own line the dead lay as thick as sheep in a fold.</p>

<p>&#8220;We ought to send for more powder,&#8221; he muttered, as he
went back to his place and loaded the blunderbuss. &#8220;More
men, maybe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Prescott already sent for more men,&#8221; growled his neighbor.
&#8220;Been sending for &#8217;em all day. Ward keeps &#8217;em all close
to Cambridge because he thinks they&#8217;re in danger there. As for
powder, there was only &#8217;leven barrels in the whole camp this
morning. Bet there&#8217;s powerful little of it left by now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got three more loadings,&#8221; said Tom. &#8220;I&#8217;ll give &#8217;em that.
Then I&#8217;ll have to bash their skulls if I bring &#8217;em down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bash their skulls then,&#8221; said the older man. &#8220;That&#8217;s as
good a way as any for the varmints to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the British made their third charge, they sent only
a token force against the rail fence. Their main attack was
directed at the redoubt. Tom fired his last charge of powder
and then flung himself over the bank to the field above.
Many other New Hampshire men were doing the same, their
powder likewise being gone.</p>

<p>At his side he saw Hugh Watts, who had driven with him
to Cambridge after the lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad news for the colonel,&#8221; said Watts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye. Bad news for everyone who knew young Caleb,&#8221;
answered Tom with a gulp. &#8220;He was a friend of mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope they got enough powder up there on the Hill,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
the Londonderry man went on. &#8220;Don&#8217;t seem as if they&#8217;re
firing as lively as they should.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom looked again at the redoubt. Black smoke was pouring
up the sky from over Charlestown way. The main
force of the British was driving toward the little fortress,
coming dangerously near. Now they passed the wooden fence.
Now a handful of them began to swarm up a locust tree that
stood in one corner of the earthen wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Great Jehovah!&#8221; gasped Hugh Watts. &#8220;They&#8217;re going
in!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was true. A last frantic burst of firing came from the redoubt,
and then its guns were still. The British poured over
the low walls in a triumphant scarlet wave.</p>

<p>&#8220;No more powder. Or they&#8217;re all dead,&#8221; said Tom grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out, lads!&#8221; he heard Captain Moore calling behind him.
&#8220;Spread over the field from Bunker Hill to the river and
cover the retreat!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tramping back across Charlestown Neck in the sunset with
the last straggling ranks of the Great American Army, Tom
Trask slowly began to realize that he was not the same Tom
Trask who had marched out so confidently to Bunker Hill.
He had seen and heard too much that afternoon to remain the
same. He had seen the King&#8217;s troops firing at him, and he
had fired back, and he wanted no more of England and the
King.</p>

<p>When the bells began to ring in Newburyport last April
and he heard the news of Concord Fight, he had gone to
camp because all the other men were going. Only a cripple or
a coward would stay at home. But he hadn&#8217;t thought much
about it, much about why there had been this Concord Fight.</p>

<p>He&#8217;d learned a little more from the talk around the campfire
at Winter Hill, but nobody seemed to be sure whether
they were fighting to make the King treat them better, or to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
get the country away from the King. Well, for himself, he
was sure now. He knew when he heard John Stark say, &#8220;I
mean to live free or die.&#8221; For that was the way he meant to
live. He knew it for sure when he heard the news that Caleb
had been shot.</p>

<p>And he had good hopes that the time would come when
he could live that way. Hadn&#8217;t he seen the British Army turn
and run&mdash;turn and run away twice?</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll fight them from now till Judgment,&#8221; he muttered
to himself. &#8220;But we&#8217;re going to be free.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little group of his dusty, tattered fellows came toiling
up and overtook him where he plodded along, trailing the
empty blunderbuss. One of them hailed him, and he saw that
it was Johnny Pettengall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Tom! We almost licked &#8217;em, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221; he called.
&#8220;If our powder&#8217;d lasted one more time.... Where was you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the rail fence and along the wall,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was in the redoubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We got slaughtered there,&#8221; said Tom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, many slaughtered,&#8221; agreed Johnny, falling into
step beside him. &#8220;We was bayoneted like so many cattle.
This&#8217;ll be remembered forever in New England as a terrible
black day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it will,&#8221; Tom said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw them shoot Dr. Warren,&#8221; continued Johnny. &#8220;Shot
him in the head just as he was leaving the redoubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I seen him once in Cambridge,&#8221; muttered Tom. &#8220;He was
a good man, I guess. It&#8217;s worse for me that we lost young
Caleb Stark.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Colonel&#8217;s son?&#8221; asked Johnny, and his face brightened.
&#8220;Oh no! That was a false report, Tom. I heard Putnam
himself telling Prescott that. Said he was sorry the boy&#8217;s
father ever got the word&mdash;but it didn&#8217;t make no difference in
the way he led his men. He said Stark&#8217;s a soldier all the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
through. Likely you and Caleb will be drinking beer together
tonight on Winter Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom drew a long breath. He looked out at the blue hills
to the west, with the red hot ball of the setting sun behind
them. He was glad that his friend was alive, but the good
news hadn&#8217;t changed his mind about one thing. He still
wanted to live free.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Chapter Sixteen</i><br />


<small>HANGING AND WIVING</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">&#8220;Do</span> you feel afraid now we&#8217;re really here?&#8221; asked Kitty.
She put her hand to Gerald Malory&#8217;s sleeve with a
light, possessive touch and looked up into his face anxiously.
Gerry smiled down at her.</p>

<p>He still wore his country clothes and a bandage round his
head, but the healthy color was coming back into his face
now. She had tended him for a week at the field hospital
below Medford Bridge, and for a week after that he had been
able to go walking with her in the sunshine every afternoon.
She and Sally Rose slept at the house of Mrs. Fulton who directed
the hospital. But Sally Rose was making new friends,
and spent less and less time among the wounded men, even
though Gerry himself was there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not half so afraid as I was that night we went back to
Charlestown to dig up the silver,&#8221; Gerry said.</p>

<p>They stood in the highroad in front of the old Royall
House where Colonel Stark had his headquarters. In a few
moments they would go in. Gerry would confess that he was
not a New Hampshire man who had got knocked on the head
at the rail fence and couldn&#8217;t remember what company he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
came from. He would admit that he was Gerald Malory of
the Twenty-third. But they would not go in just yet. It was
a soft summer night with the fragrance of garden flowers in
the air. He drew her down beside him on the low brick wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;What were you afraid of that night?&#8221; she asked him.
&#8220;When we went to The Sign of the Sun to get a pass from
the British major so we could go into town, I thought he
seemed like a very kind man.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry grinned down at her. &#8220;He was kind to you, certainly.
From the look in his eye, he&#8217;d have given you Boston Common
and Long Wharf too, if you&#8217;d asked for them. You&#8217;ve
a way with us menfolk, Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty let her long lashes fall across her cheek, then she
looked up at him suddenly and smiled. &#8220;Do you know, it&#8217;s
the strangest thing, I do seem to have a way with them lately.
But before I knew you, I never had any way with them at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cleared his throat and looked away from her. &#8220;Yes,
you&#8217;re blooming out, my girl,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Kitty sighed happily. &#8220;Oh I do hope so! For so many years
nobody noticed me at all beside Sally Rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, Sally Rose!&#8221; he muttered. &#8220;Honestly, I feel guilty
there. How am I ever going to tell her that I&mdash;that I&mdash;have
taken a fancy to you, Kitty?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is a fancy all you&#8217;ve taken?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A deep down kind of fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; She was silent for a moment, and then she said, &#8220;If
you feel guilty about Sally Rose, how do you think I feel
about Tom Trask, the New Hampshire boy? How am I
going to tell him I&#8217;ve taken a fancy to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not answer, and after a moment she repeated her
earlier question. &#8220;What were you afraid of when we went to
Charlestown that night? It was sad, really, but I didn&#8217;t see
any reason to be afraid.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>She remembered the forlorn look of the town, its cellar
holes still smoking, only a few old houses left near the millpond,
the moss on the gravestones scorched away. But they
had found and brought back the silverware.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid I might be recognized and sent to rejoin my
regiment. You know I don&#8217;t want that to happen to me,
Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty slipped out of his encircling arm and jumped to her
feet. &#8220;I know,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why I coaxed you to come
and tell the whole thing to Colonel Stark. If he says you can
stay here and be an American, then you&#8217;ll have no more cause
to be afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose he says I&#8217;m a deserter and an enemy, and ought
to be hanged on Cambridge Common? He may even think
I&#8217;m a spy, Kitty.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stood up and held out both his hands. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think
he&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; said Kitty slowly. &#8220;Colonel Stark ought to
understand any man who wants to be an American. You can&#8217;t
go on pretending always&mdash;always being afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>They heard a throat cleared sharply on the other side of
the low wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you young folks have any other place to do your
courting?&#8221; asked Colonel Stark.</p>

<p>Gerry turned quickly round, and Kitty drew a deep breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&mdash;we were on our way to consult you, Colonel&mdash;about
a small matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Stark inclined his head. &#8220;Come inside then,&#8221; he
ordered. &#8220;I trust the young woman has no complaint against
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no!&#8221; cried Kitty in embarrassment and alarm.</p>

<p>The three of them walked together up the broad graveled
path between the boxwood hedges, and in at the wide front
door. Kitty had heard much about Isaac Royall, the owner
of the house, a rich Tory who had fled to Boston, but she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
not prepared for the carved elegance and panelled wainscot of
the great hall. She had never before seen a room like the
white and gold parlor where Colonel Stark seated them. It
reassured her a little to see his somewhat battered musket
leaning against the rosewood desk, a cartridge box flung down
on a brocade chair.</p>

<p>&#8220;O&#8217;erlook the disorder if you will,&#8221; he said, picking up the
cartridge box. &#8220;I been at Cambridge all day, and Molly&#8217;s
housemaids are forbidden to meddle with my field equipment.
Well, lad,&#8221; and he turned to Gerry, his mouth severe,
but a twinkle in his cold blue eye. &#8220;You say you come here
to see me about some matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes sir,&#8221; said Gerry, clenching his fists and leaning forward.
&#8220;Colonel Stark, sir, I been abed in your field hospital
ever since the battle at Charlestown. I said to all that I came
from New Hampshire, but since I was wounded I couldn&#8217;t
remember my town or the name of my captain. I told a lie,
sir. I am Gerald Malory of the Twenty-third.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Stark quietly. The twinkle in his eye
deepened.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&mdash;you know it? How?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven&#8217;t forgotten you was our prisoner after the Ipswich
Fright, have you? I won&#8217;t question you about the Fright too
much. That&#8217;s water under the bridge. Might have enjoyed it
myself, when I was a lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry hung his head, and the Colonel went on. &#8220;You was
recognized by more&#8217;n a dozen men when we carted you back
from the Hill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then&mdash;why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t we clap you back in gaol again? Well, maybe
we should have. I decided instead to have you watched. I
wanted to find out your game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t any game,&#8221; said Gerry miserably.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>&#8220;So it was beginning to seem,&#8221; agreed Stark. &#8220;What are
you? Tired of fighting? A deserter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I suppose so,&#8221; said Gerry. &#8220;I never meant to be a soldier.
But after I got in trouble at home, it seemed the best
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stark cleared his throat. &#8220;You got a father?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;A father? Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At home in England?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you think he&#8217;d feel if he knew you was behaving
so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;d care,&#8221; said Gerry. &#8220;After my mother
died, he took a young wife and has other sons. New one every
year. &#8217;Twas getting so there was no room at home for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gradually, under the Colonel&#8217;s shrewd questioning, Gerry
Malory&#8217;s whole story came clear. Kitty had heard much of
it before, but not all. He told about his mother, the strolling
player; how after her death he had left grammar school, and
ranged with a wild group of friends about the farms and the
town. Then he was taken up for poaching in the squire&#8217;s
woodland&mdash;caught the first unlucky time he set a bit of a
rabbit snare. And the recruiting sergeant came by in the thick
of the trouble, and there you were. No, he wasn&#8217;t a captain
and never had been. He never thought pretending to be one
was a dishonest trick, since he never gained thereby. He
thought it was like taking a part in a play, and better to
choose a leading part. He wasn&#8217;t even twenty years old, as
he had said; wouldn&#8217;t be eighteen till next December came.</p>

<p>Stark pondered. &#8220;All that I can see,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;I
been a lad myself, though, thank God, none such a foolhardy
one. But after the battle&mdash;what did you do with the boots you
wore when they brought you in, the boots that went with
your British uniform?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My boots?&#8221; asked Gerry. He looked down at his feet.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
He was wearing a pair of cowhide shoes Kitty had bought for
him at a shop in Medford Square. &#8220;Why, I don&#8217;t know what
became of my boots.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hid them,&#8221; said Kitty defiantly. &#8220;I was afraid&mdash;if the
doctors thought he was British&mdash;they&#8217;d just let him die. I
pulled them off, and took them outside, and threw them
down the well.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Stark slapped his knee and laughed with a quiet,
wry kind of mirth. &#8220;So I suppose from now on the water at
The Sign of the Sun will taste o&#8217; British leather,&#8221; he said.
Then he turned to Gerry. &#8220;Well, a spirited lass is none so bad
to have for a wife. I got one myself. Do you mean to marry
her for her kindness to you&mdash;if you don&#8217;t have to hang, of
course?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for her kindness,&#8221; said Gerry Malory firmly, his eyes
lighting. &#8220;I mean to marry her&mdash;well, because I mean to
marry her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well enough said,&#8221; agreed the colonel. &#8220;But I mentioned
the other, the hanging matter. Can you think of any reason
against it?&#8221;</p>

<p>A tragic look came over Gerry&#8217;s face, and his voice took
on a deep vibrant note of pleading. It seemed to Kitty that
she could see and hear his actress mother there.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t hang a man for a mistake, would you,
Colonel? A mistake that was made a hundred and fifty years
ago?&#8221; He paused and shut his eyes dramatically.</p>

<p>Colonel Stark gave Kitty a slow, solemn wink, and she
knew that he was thinking of the actress mother, too.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the mistake, lad,&#8221; he demanded, &#8220;and who
made it? You weren&#8217;t making mistakes a hundred and fifty
years ago. Yours were all ahead of you then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was an old ancestor of mine, sir, who went down to
the docks in Plymouth and thought to sail with the folk who
came here to found your own Plymouth Colony. He thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
he would come with them and be an American, but he
changed his mind and went back to Barnstaple, and the
family&#8217;s been there ever since. That was the mistake he made.
If it hadn&#8217;t been for him&mdash;I might ha&#8217; been fighting on your
side in this war.&#8221;</p>

<p>Colonel Stark gazed sharply at the young man and saw
what Kitty hoped he would see: that for all the pretentious
manner, the words were true. Then he turned away for a
moment and stared through the window where the moonlight
was turning white flowered stalks to silver in the garden.</p>

<p>&#8220;My folks didn&#8217;t make that mistake,&#8221; he said abruptly.
&#8220;They come here on a ship, like all the rest of us, except
those who be Injun bred. Come out o&#8217; Scotland, my folks.
Had five young ones die on the voyage, and raised another
five to replace &#8217;em. Yes, your ancestor made a mistake, lad.
But how do you think to right it? Peace time, you could come
here like other Englishmen always did, and settle down and
be one of us. But not now, now that we be at war.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t I, Colonel? That was what I was hoping for.
It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m afraid of fighting. But I don&#8217;t want to fight
against you. And I can&#8217;t fight against my own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what would you do, Private Malory, if I said, &#8216;Go
to! Clear out of my camp and make your way as best you
can?&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Gerry&#8217;s face lit up, and there was no play-acting about him
this time. &#8220;Why, I&#8217;d thought about that, Colonel. Do you
know what I&#8217;d do? I sailed from Plymouth myself, for my
regiment took ship there, so for old times&#8217; sake, I&#8217;d take the
highroad and go down to your Plymouth in Massachusetts,
and see if I could make my way there and settle in, and
become a Plymouth man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We got a Plymouth in New Hampshire,&#8221; said Stark
thoughtfully. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether all the land be taken
there or no.&#8221; Then the lines in his face hardened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>&#8220;I got the power tonight to send you on your way,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Tomorrow, I may be plain Johnny Stark, headed back
to the sawmill again. We got a new commander coming up
from the South to take over the whole army. Name o&#8217; Washington.
A Virginia man. Can&#8217;t tell what he&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>On that July night the name of Washington meant nothing
to Kitty Greenleaf and Gerald Malory.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then let me go, Colonel Stark. Let me go tonight,&#8221;
Gerry pleaded.</p>

<p>The colonel looked down at the rich woven rug on the
floor. His eyes seemed to be tracing the scrollwork pattern.
Then he turned to Gerry again. &#8220;There&#8217;s only one thing still
bothers me, Private Malory,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I believe you when
you say you&#8217;d like to be an American, and settle down in
America and make your way there, and do no harm to anyone.
I commend you for it. But how do you feel toward your
own people? Don&#8217;t you believe in Parliament and the King?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe in them&mdash;over there,&#8221; said Gerry slowly. &#8220;But
not over here. They rule fine in England, it seems to me. But
in America&mdash;the way I&#8217;ve come to see America&mdash;they don&#8217;t
know what they&#8217;re doing at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stark&#8217;s grin told Kitty that he had heard the answer he
wanted to hear, but he had one more word of caution. &#8220;Remember,
you been knocked in the head, lad. Are you sure you
know what you&#8217;re about? That you won&#8217;t wake up in a daze
some morning and wish you was back with the Twenty-third?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Gerry. &#8220;I won&#8217;t wish myself back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stark got to his feet. &#8220;Might happen,&#8221; he said mildly, &#8220;if
you was to slip out of camp long about midnight, sentry
would be looking the other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Gerry fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank me in ten years,&#8221; said Stark, &#8220;if you still want to
then. It&#8217;s a crazy venture, and we can&#8217;t tell how it&#8217;ll turn out.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
But if it&#8217;s what you want, get on with it. They say hanging
and wiving goes by destiny. And I guess you&#8217;re lucky in both
o&#8217; them matters, lad.&#8221;</p>

<p>He led them toward the front door, and as they passed by
a small parlor opening off the hall, Kitty caught sight of a
couple inside it. They sat on a peacock-colored sofa, locked
in a deep embrace. Startled at the sound of footsteps, they
drew apart. Stark shot a quick look in their direction and
grinned widely. &#8220;No harm in it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they&#8217;re a betrothed
pair.&#8221; He would have kept on down the hall, but
Kitty stood still, gasping.</p>

<p>The man on the blue sofa was Tom Trask, and the girl was
a stranger to her; small and delicately formed, with a beautiful
cameo face and shining red hair. Under their scrutiny
Tom stood up. Some men would have been embarrassed, but
not he. He scooped the girl to her feet and led her forward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he greeted them, &#8220;so it&#8217;s Kit herself, and <i>Private</i>
Malory. I&#8217;d like you to meet Jeanie Morrison.&#8221; He looked
down at the red-haired girl, and there was a tender merriment
in his eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I kissed with all the girls some,&#8221; he continued. &#8220;But I
always knew I&#8217;d marry Jean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to the man!&#8221; trilled Jeanie. She gave him an enchanting
smile that showed a dimple in her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Jeanie come down from Derryfield with my wife a few
days back,&#8221; explained the colonel, sensing some tension in the
air he could not understand. &#8220;She came to see Tom and bring
him his gun. A Brown Bess, British made, one of the best guns
in the army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye,&#8221; said Tom mockingly. &#8220;I got my own gun. You
can have your blunderbuss back, Kitty. I&#8217;ll bring it to the
hospital tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother,&#8221; said Kitty, but Gerry&#8217;s eyes lighted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>&#8220;Is there any way we could get it tonight?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Kitty knew what he was thinking, and she saw the rightness
of it. He meant to go to Plymouth, armed with the Plymouth
blunderbuss.</p>

<p>Tom shrugged, &#8220;If you want it that bad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;As a
matter of fact, I brought it with me. You&#8217;ll find it standing
among the lilacs to the right of the front door.&#8221;</p>

<p>After they had retrieved the old weapon and taken their
leave of Colonel Stark, they walked quietly through the
streets of Medford hand in hand.</p>

<p>Kitty should have been relieved that she would have no
painful scene with Tom, but she could not help feeling rueful
at the knowledge that he had preferred red-haired Jeanie
all the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re lucky,&#8221; Gerry assured her. &#8220;I wish&mdash;I wish I
could get out of it so easy with Sally Rose.&#8221;</p>

<p>He kissed her on the steps of the Fulton house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know when I&#8217;ll be back, Kitty,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It may
take me a long time to make my own way. And you&mdash;now
your grandmother&#8217;s dead, where will you go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll go back to her old house and wait till you
come for me. You&#8217;ve never been to Newburyport, but you
can find the way. You&#8217;ll be gone tomorrow, and I&#8217;m going to
Cambridge and get old Timothy and take him home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will Sally Rose go with you?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think?&#8221; said Kitty. &#8220;Look there!&#8221; She
pointed to the parlor window just to the left of the front
door.</p>

<p>Sally Rose was standing inside the parlor. She was smiling
up into the eyes of a tall young captain who wore the blue
and white of the Connecticut line. She let her lashes veil her
eyes and opened her pretty lips. &#8220;We&#8217;ve none such handsome
lads in Massachusetts&mdash;&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Gerry Malory swallowed. Then he began to laugh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
&#8220;Where, oh where,&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;have I heard those
words before?&#8221;</p>

<p>After he had left her, Kitty slipped into the house and up
to the little chamber that she shared with Sally Rose. She
went to the window and stood there, looking at the still town,
and the moonlit river, the campfires on Winter Hill, the
lights of the warships far down the dim bay.</p>

<p>Less than three months back, it was, that they had all
played hide-and-seek in Newburyport, but they would never
play hide-and-seek again. Never again would they be that
young.</p>

<p>Even she and Sally Rose, Gran had said, would be great-grandmothers
some day. How glad she was that Gran had
had that last cup of tea.</p>

<p>She turned from the window and began to undress, laughing
as she remembered the struggle to get Sally Rose out of
the stays. Never again, she thought, would they be as young
as that.</p>

<p>She was just climbing into bed when Sally Rose opened
the chamber door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Kitty,&#8221; she said, &#8220;there&#8217;s going to be handsome men in
uniform about for ages. Captain Davenport was just telling
me that he expects a long war. He says that since Bunker
Hill, the word&#8217;s been in everybody&#8217;s mouth that we&#8217;re going
to live free or die&mdash;and that will take a long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Live free or die? What does that mean?&#8221; asked Kitty,
bewildered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t understand it myself,&#8221; said Sally Rose,
taking the ribbon out of her curls, &#8220;but I have an idea of one
man who might know. I think you&#8217;ll be likely to find out if
you go and speak to Tom Trask.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kitty lay in the wide bed and watched her cousin slip out
of her dainty garments and fling them carelessly across a
chair. Yes, she thought, there was, after all, some sort of unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
wisdom about the pretty featherbrain. Hanging and
wiving goes by destiny, Colonel Stark had said, and she had
known that Gerry was her destiny, almost from the day she
had seen him first from the door of the Bay and Beagle as
he marched past with the prisoners&#8217; cart. And she would not
have it otherwise, for she loved Gerry. He would be as good
an American as most others, some day. He had many virtues,
and she would rejoice and be proud of them all her life,
most likely. But when it came to a matter of living free, Sally
Rose was right. Tom Trask was the man who would know.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
